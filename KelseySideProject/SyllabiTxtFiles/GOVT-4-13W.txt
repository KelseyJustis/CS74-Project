Government 4: Politics of the World
1. Course Description: This course provides an introduction to the field of comparative politics, defined as the study of political dynamics within countries around the world. The course focuses on several classic debates in the comparative politics field that have particular relevance to today's world. These include: democracy and democratization, variation in how democracies work, causes of civil conflict, and the cultural foundations of politics. In exploring these themes, we will examine and critically evaluate several different approaches to politics, including structural, cultural, and institutional approaches. Cases will be drawn from different regions and historical periods to ground students in the tools of comparative analysis.
2. Course Goals: (1) To cultivate an interest in the study of world politics. (2) To engage in several major debates in the comparative politics field. (3) To gain an appreciation of social science methodology (how we study the things we study). (4) To gain experience with the application of theoretical arguments to case studies. (5) To learn about the modern political histories of several country case studies.
3. Assignments:
Pop Quizzes Over the course of the quarter, I will give six pop quizzes at the beginning of class. The goal is to provide an incentive that encourages students to keep up with the readings and to reward those who do so. The quizzes will take just a few minutes, and will consist of a few basic questions about the readings for that day (main arguments, key facts, results, conclusions, etc.). I will not ask about obscure stuff, but rather stuff that should be evident if you have done the reading for class reasonably carefully. Filling in your name will count as one question, which is to say you'll get some credit for showing up. To minimize inequities resulting from students missing a quiz due to sickness, other unforeseen absence, or something that prevents you from doing the reading before a class, each student's lowest quiz grade will be dropped before the quiz grade average is calculated. If you anticipate being absent because of a Dartmouth obligation (e.g., sports team on the road) or an excusable personal event (e.g., family emergency), send me an email and I will excuse you from the quiz if held on the day you miss.

Exams (2)
There will be two in-class exams. Each exam will draw from the assigned readings and class discussions up to that point. The second exam will focus more heavily on material from the latter
portion of the term. Exams are generally a mixture of short answer questions (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, or identification questions) and an essay.

Paper
Each student will produce a final paper (roughly 5-7 pages), due during the exam period. Instructions for submitting papers will be provided.

Grades will be calculated as follows:

4. Course Materials The following books are available for purchase at Wheelock Books (copies are also on reserve in the library). All other readings can be accessed through blackboard.
Kotkin, Stephen. 2008. Armageddon Averted: The Soviet Collapse 1970-2000. (Updated edition). Oxford: Oxford University Press.
Putnam, Robert. 1993. Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.

5. Additional resources:
PowerPoint slides: At the end of each week, I will place a copy of any PowerPoint slides I have used in class on blackboard. I do not post these before class because note taking is a valuable exercise, and I do not want my slides to substitute for your own notes.
Background information: The course draws on a wide range of country studies and case materials. At times you may find yourself wanting to know more about the basic information and background that the assigned readings take for granted, like where the place could be found on a map, or which party controlled the government from 1993 to 1996. This is to be expected, so don't worry. But do get the information you need to make sense of whatever you don't understand. There are a number of ways to get background information when you need it. One is to ask me. I might know the answer, and if I don't I can usually figure out where to find it. It is always OK to bring questions to class, and to speak up during lecture if something warrants further explanation. Another sometimes-good source of basic background information on politics in various countries is Wikipedia.

The Academic Skills Center. The Academic Skills Center provides a variety of services designed to help students excel academically (e.g., tutors, study groups, skills-building workshops, etc.). For more info, visit dartmouth.edu/~acskills/ The Student Center for Writing, Research, and Information Technology (RWIT). RWIT provides students with assistance in conceptualizing, researching, and proofreading written work. For more info, visit dartmouth.edu/~rwit/
6. Class Policies: The Honor Principle. All students are reminded of their obligation to conduct themselves in accordance with the Standards of Conduct in general and with the Academic Honor Principle in particular. The Academic Honor Principle is available at www.dartmouth.edu/~uja/honor/. Please review the section on plagiarism in particular and contact me if you have any questions. X-Hours. While I have only scheduled one meeting during x-hours, I reserve the option to use other periods if we need extra time to cover the material on the syllabus. Students should therefore not schedule other obligations that conflict with the x-hour for this course. Late papers will be penalized one-third grade per day. If you anticipate that you will have a problem meeting a deadline due to an excusable issue (e.g., family emergency, grave illness, etc.) contact me before the assignment is due to make appropriate arrangements. Disabilities. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact me before the end of the second week of the term to arrange appropriate accommodations. Religious Observance. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please contact me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations. Office Hours. I will be available during the times noted on the first page for meetings with students. If you are unable to meet during these times, please email me to set up an appointment for an alternative time.
