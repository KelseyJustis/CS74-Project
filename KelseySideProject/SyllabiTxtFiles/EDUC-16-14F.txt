   COURSE  DESCRIPTION   This  course  challenges  students  to  think  critically  about  the  relationship  between  what   we  know  about  the  mind  from  experimental  research  in  the  lab  and  how  we  teach   students  to  learn  in  classrooms.  The  main  focus  is  on  reading  empirical  articles  and   reviews  of  research  that  highlight  the  major  concepts  and  theories  from  Psychology  and   Neuroscience  that  have  bearing  on  Education.  We  will  discuss  the  relationship  between   learning  and  such  topics  as  working  memory,  reinforcement,  semantic  knowledge,   experience  and  practice,  and  what  should  be  the  role  of  neuroscience  research  in   informing  educational  practice.       The  main  goals  of  this  course  are  to:   - Become  proficient  at  reading  empirical  research  articles  in  experimental  psychology,  
neuroscience,  and  education   - Become  familiar  with  the  major  concepts  and  theoretical  models  from  psychology  and  
neuroscience  that  relate  to  education   - Become  adept  at  evaluating  the  merit  of  claims  from  proposed  educational  
interventions  (and  from  the  media)  regarding  neuroscience  or  psychology  concepts      COURSE  REQUIREMENTS   - All  readings  will  be  available  on  Canvas  and  you  are  required  to  read  the  assigned  
papers  before  class.   - In-class  discussion  of  assigned  readings  is  a  critical  component  of  this  course  and  will  
be  facilitated  by  bringing  the  printed  articles  to  class  for  your  reference.     - Developing  the  skills  of  critically  reading  empirical  research  articles  and  writing  for  a  
scientific  audience  are  central  to  achieving  the  course  goals.      GRADING  OVERVIEW   20%   Midterm  Exam   20%   Final  Exam   15%   Quizzes:  6  total  (drop  lowest)   15%   Research  Paper   15%   Group  Presentation   13%   Class  Participation  and  Attendance     2%   Research  Participation  (or  alternative  assignment)

GENERAL  POLICIES     
1. Read  all  materials  and  prepare  for  class.    You  are  expected  to  read  the   materials  posted  on  Blackboard  before  each  class.    Be  prepared  to  discuss  that   material  in  class.  Everyone  is  expected  to  come  to  every  class  and  to  arrive  on  time.     You  are  also  expected  to  contribute  to  class  discussion.    You  will  learn  the  material   better  and  others  will  learn  from  you.    The  success  of  this  course  depends  on   everyone  coming  to  class  prepared  and  ready  to  discuss  the  material.  Both   attendance  (on-time)  and  preparation  for  class  will  determine  a  portion  of  your   grade  (see  "Assignments  and  Assessments"  below).      
2. Tell  me  sooner  rather  than  later.    If  you  know  ahead  of  time  that  you  will  be   missing  a  class,  e.g.,  for  sports,  please  let  me  know  in  advance  in  order  to  avoid   losing  participation  credit.  Some  students  may  wish  to  take  part  in  religious   observances  that  occur  during  this  academic  term.  If  you  have  a  religious   observance  that  conflicts  with  your  participation  in  the  course,  please  meet  with   me  before  the  end  of  the  second  week  of  the  term  to  discuss  appropriate   accommodations.  
3. ASSUME  THAT  I  WILL  NOT  ACCEPT  LATE  ASSIGNMENTS.   4. Cell  phones  are  not  to  be  used  in  class.  If  an  emergency  arises  that  requires  the  
use  of  a  phone,  please  quietly  excuse  yourself  from  the  room  to  respond.       5. Accommodations.  Students  with  learning,  physical,  or  psychiatric  disabilities  
enrolled  in  this  course  who  may  need  disability-related  classroom   accommodations  are  encouraged  to  make  an  office  appointment  to  see  me  early  in   the  semester  (i.e.,  within  the  first  two  weeks).  If  you  have  not  done  so  already,   students  requiring  disability-related  accommodations  should  register  with  the   Student  Accessibility  Services  office  (301  Collis  Student  Center).     Dartmouth's  policies  and  resources:  http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility   Contact  info:  646-9900,  Student.Accessibility.Services@Dartmouth.edu   6. Plagiarism  is  unacceptable.    All  work  submitted  as  your  own  must  be  written  by   you  and  not  previously  submitted  for  any  other  class.  It  is  important  to  attribute   material  that  is  the  work  of  others  to  the  original  source.  If  you  are  unsure  how  to   properly  cite  a  source,  please  consult  with  me  prior  to  handing  in  an  assignment   (and  see:  http://www.dartmouth.edu/~writing/sources/  ).    You  should  be   familiar  with  Dartmouth's  Honor  Principle,  which  applies  to  all  courses  at   Dartmouth  (available  here:  www.dartmouth.edu/~uja/honor/  ).  I  do  not  expect   any  violations  of  this  code,  but  if  any  concerns  do  arise  I  will  forward  all  related   materials  to  Dartmouth's  Committee  on  Standards.   7. Before  you  turn  in  your  papers...  make  sure  that  you  use  12-point Times New Roman font,  that  you  double-space  the  whole  document,  that  your  print  margins   are  1-inch  on  all  sides  (not  the  default  in  Word),  that  all  your  pages  are  numbered,   and  that  your  document  is  stapled  together  (if  printed).    For  citations  in  all  papers,   you  must  use  APA  Style  formatting  (refer  to  the  APA  Style  Manual  or  online   guides,  such  as:  http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/  )
