Course Description: This class will examine jazz from its origins to the present. Special attention will be given to pivotal figures in the history of jazz such as Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Ornette Coleman. Class time will be spent listening to, analyzing, and discussing a wide variety of recorded jazz performances and watching jazz films. We will also have a number of visiting artists perform in class and lecture on relevant topics.
Outside of class you will be attending live jazz performances, listening to recordings and reading about the artists that brought this music to life. My goal is to help you increase your understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of this great American art form called Jazz.
After an introductory period during which we will focus on the basic elements of music and how to listen to jazz, we will consider representative instrumental and vocal recordings from the past one hundred years.
