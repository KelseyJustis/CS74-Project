Course Description
Ethnomusicology is the study of music, particularly that outside the Western classical tradition, in its social and cultural context.

Course work includes reading and critical writing as well as listening and viewing assignments.

Attendance Policy
The Music 45 attendance policy follows from the general attendance policy of Dartmouth College detailed in the ORC:
"Regular class attendance is expected of all students. Though academic schedules may sometimes conflict with College-sponsored or College-recognized extracurricular events, there are no excused absences for participants in such activities. Students who participate in athletics, debates, concerts, or other activities should check their calendars to see that these events do not conflict with their academic schedules. Should such conflicts occur or be anticipated, each student is responsible for discussing the matter with his or her instructor at the beginning of the appropriate term. Instructors may be accommodating if approached well in advance of the critical date. Such accommodations can be made only when the conflict occurs because of a scheduled Collegesponsored or College-recognized event. No participant should expect to be excused in order to attend a team meeting or orientation session, practice session, meal, or other such activity."
The only excused absences from class are in the event of illness or a family emergency (if you are absent for one of these reasons, please ask your dean or a health service professional to submit a note to the Music 45 TA, Amber Dewey, confirming the reason for your absence). Attendance will be taken at random times throughout the term. Unexcused absence from class will affect the attendance component of your course grade.
Laptop Computers in Class Please refrain from using laptops or other digital devices during class meetings.
Students with Disabilities Students who may require special arrangements for completing assignments on account of a documented disability are invited to discuss their needs with the course instructor.
Distributive and World Culture Requirement This course satisfied the ART Distributive Requirement and the NW (Non-Western Cultures) World Culture Requirement. Music 4/AMES 30 cannot be used to satisfy other distributive or world culture requirements.

Learning Goals for the Course
· Develop a broad familiarity with the cultural geography of Central Eurasia · Learn about the forms, structures, and aesthetic criteria that shape different musical "languages" · Learn how different societies conceptualize sound and music · Develop a more sophisticated and precise vocabulary in which to speak about music · Improve skills in critical writing · Challenge yourself to step outside your own cultural conditioning to hear sound and music through the
ears of listeners from other cultures.
Ten principal questions and themes that run through the course:
1) Why is music powerful? What are the sources of its alleged powers? 2) How does music represents and reflect broader cultural practices and beliefs? 3) How does music serve as a metaphor for social, religious, and political ideas? 4) What is musical creativity? What do musicians create music from? 5) Who is a musician? What kind of training or preparation do musicians undergo? 6) What is "tradition" in music? Can "traditional music also be contemporary, and if so, how? 7) How do musicians appropriate traditional forms to create new hybrid works? 8) How does music abet the construction and articulation of collective identities and cultural boundaries? 9) What are the effects of cultural globalization on local musical languages and styles? 10) To what extent are responses to music "hardwired"? Do musical universals exist?
