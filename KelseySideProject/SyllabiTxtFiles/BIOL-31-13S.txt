Course overview: W hat factors determine the distribution and abundance of organisms? This course is an exploration of environm ental effects on fundam ental physiological processes in plants and anim als. Abiotic factors such as tem perature and water availability interact with biotic forces such as predation, herbivory, and com petition to constrain the ability of organism s to survive, grow, and reproduce. Physiological solutions that allow success in one environment may preclude it in another. This course seeks to build up from physiological principles to understand characteristics of populations, comm unities, and ecosystem s. Prerequisite: at least one of Biol 12-16.
Grading policy: Grading will be based on two m idterm examinations, a com prehensive final exam, and laboratory activities (including an independent research project). Note that midterm exams are on the evenings of 18 April and 14 May at 19:00. Late exams will not be given except under extraordinary circumstances that are discussed with the professor by phone or in person prior to the exam. Late laboratory assignm ents will be penalized 10% per day up to a m axim um of 30% penalty. I encourage students with disabilities of any kind to discuss them with me so that appropriate accom m odations can be made.
