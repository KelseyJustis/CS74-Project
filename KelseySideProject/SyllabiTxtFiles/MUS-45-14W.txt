Ethnomusicology
Musical Intersections between Judaism and Islam
Music 45/AMES 45/Jewish Studies 57 Winter 2014
Instructors: Theodore Levin (Music) and Edwin Seroussi (Jewish Studies) Teaching Assistant: Sarah Wang Office Hours: by appointment
Course Description
Ethnomusicology is the study of music-particularly that outside the Western classical tradition-in its social and cultural context. In 2014, the course focuses on the musical cultures of one large geographical area: the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia, where the interaction of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism has produced both convergence and contrast in the rich array of musical traditions shaped by the Abrahamic belief systems and the social practices that have emerged from them.
Course Requirements
· Regular class attendance (see attendance policy below) · Timely completion of reading, viewing, and listening assignments. · Submission of all written work in accordance with the deadlines stated in the syllabus;
late submissions may be subject to grading penalties.
Course Materials:
Viewing, listening, and reading assignments will be made available on Course Reserves.
Course Work:
Course work consists of weekly assignments that include a combination of reading, viewing, listening, and writing.
Attendance Policy
The Music 45/AMES 45/Jewish Studies 57 attendance policy follows from the general attendance policy of Dartmouth College detailed in the ORC:
"Regular class attendance is expected of all students. Though academic schedules may sometimes conflict with College-sponsored or College-recognized extracurricular events, there are no excused absences for participants in such activities. Students who participate in athletics, debates, concerts, or other activities should check their calendars to see that these events do not conflict with their academic schedules. Should such conflicts occur or be anticipated, each student is responsible for discussing the matter with his or her instructor at the beginning of the appropriate term. Instructors may be accommodating if approached well in advance of the critical date. Such accommodations can be made only when the conflict occurs because of a scheduled College-sponsored or College-recognized event. No participant should expect to be excused in order to attend a team meeting or orientation session, practice session, meal, or other such activity."

2

The only excused absences from class are in the event of illness or a family emergency (if you are absent for one of these reasons, please ask your dean or a health service professional to submit a note to the Music 45 TA, Sarah Wang, confirming the reason for your absence). Attendance will be taken at random times throughout the term. Unexcused absence from class will affect the class participation component of your course grade.

Evaluation and Grading:

Class members will be evaluated and graded on the following basis: · Attendance and class participation (ability to offer informed comments on weekly reading and listening assignments) (15%) · 3 quizzes (@5%) · 1 critical listening exercise (15%)\ · 1 essay assignment (15%) · Recording review (15%) · Research Paper or Project (25%)

Criteria for grading are those detailed in the ORC under "Scholarship Ratings": http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/2013/orc/Regulations/UndergraduateStudy/Requirements-for-the-Degree-of-Bachelor-of-Arts/Scholarship-Ratings Grading of papers and exams is numerical. Numerical totals will be converted to letter grades at the end of the term according to the following scheme:
