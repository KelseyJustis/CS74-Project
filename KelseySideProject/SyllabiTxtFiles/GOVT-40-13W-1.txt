COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course offers a survey of Japanese politics with a focus on understanding the electoral and policy-making processes in Japan from theoretical and comparative perspectives. No prior knowledge of Japanese politics is required. The course will explore electoral systems and voting behavior, candidate selection and electoral campaign, dynamics of party competition, executive-legislative relationships, local politics and central-local relationships, the roles of the mass media and civil society in policy making, etc.

The course is roughly divided into three parts. The first part will introduce the current status of Japanese politics and approaches to the study of Japanese politics. The second part will provide students with an overview of post-war political history in Japan. The third part will examine various topics examined in the broader theoretical and comparative literatures, by treating Japan as a case.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this course include the following:

1. To expand students' interest in contemporary Japanese politics, specifically, and in comparative politics, more generally.
2. To provide students an introduction to key institutional and political changes in Japan since the formation of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in 1955.
3. To provide students exposure to theoretically and methodologically important studies, which use Japan as a case
4. To help students improve their skills to evaluate existing studies, which test empirical causal hypotheses based on rigorous research methods
5. To provide a foundation for further exploration of topics that may be of particular interest

PRE-REQUISTES
This course is designed for students who have already taken Government 4 (Introduction to Comparative Politics) or equivalent, and Government 10 (Quantitative Political Analysis) or equivalent. No prior knowledge of Japanese politics is required
Some articles assigned for Part 2, and most articles assigned for Part 3, of this course are based on mid-level to advanced-level statistical analysis. Methodological instructions will be given as much as possible to help students understand each article's statistical methods and results. It is, however, not required for students to fully understand the technical details of these papers.
ASSIGNMENTS
Your overall grade for this course is made up of the following elements:
15% Pop Quizzes 20% A Midterm Exam 10% A Film Review 20% A Podcast Project 20% A Final Paper 15% Participation (in-class & online)
Pop Quizzes
During the quarter, I will give six pop quizzes at the beginning of class. The goal is to provide an incentive that encourages students to keep up with the readings and to reward those who do so. The quizzes will take just a few minutes, and will consist of a few basic questions about the readings for that day (main arguments, key facts, results, conclusions, etc.). I will not ask about obscure stuff, but rather stuff that should be evident if you have done the reading for class reasonably carefully. Filling in your name will count as one question, which is to say you will get some credit for showing up. To minimize inequities resulting from students missing a quiz due to sickness, other unforeseen absence, or something that prevents you from doing the reading before a class, each student's lowest quiz grade will be dropped before the quiz grade average is calculated.
Important: If you know in advance of a class session that you will be absent because of a Dartmouth obligation or an excusable personal event, please send an email to me as soon as possible.
A Midterm Exam
There will be a mid-term examination on February 11 (Mon) from 10:00 to 11:15. It will draw from assigned readings and class discussions up to that point. The exam will be a mixture of short answer questions (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and/or identification questions) and an essay or two. During the exam, students can refer to your own handwritten materials (i.e., your notes) and printed-out lecturer notes, but not to books, articles, and online resources. A review session will be held on February 7 (Thu).

A Film Review
All students should watch both of the following documentary films on Japanese election campaigns before the discussion session on February 6 (Wed).
· Senkyo [Campaign] (2006) directed by Kazuhiko Soda · Pictures at an Election (2008) directed by Axel Klein
After the discussion session, each student should write a "film review" (no more than 3 pages, 12 font, double space) based on one or both of these films. The deadline to submit the review is February 18 (Monday), 10:00am.
You should write it as if you were a professional reviewer. The targeted hypothetical readers are average Dartmouth students who may not necessarily know much about Japanese politics. You should write a brief story line, and try to convince the hypothetical readers why and how the film/s you choose to review is/are interesting and insightful.
You should also try to make your own interpretation of behaviors and outcomes, shown in the film/s, from theoretical and/or comparative perspectives. In other words, instead of saying that some particular scenes in the film are interesting/strange/amazing, you should discuss why they are interesting/strange/amazing (e.g., compared to election campaigns in the U.S.).
Important: You should never copy and paste the existing reviews of these documentary films. In other words, you should use own words in writing your review. If you cite existing books (e.g., Gerald Curtis' Election Campaigning Japanese Style), articles (e.g., some articles assigned to class), or existing film reviews (available on the web), you should cite them properly.
A Podcast Project
In Week 2, students will be divided into groups. Each group should meet regularly during x-periods and other available time slots to collaborate on a group project. The task is to make a short, podcast program (up to 5 minutes). You can choose to focus on anything relevant to Japanese politics ­ e.g., a story of particular Japanese politician, a particular event during the post-war period, a particularly policy issue at stake, etc. The minimal style of presentation is to ask one of your group members to read a script you jointly draft, and record it. You should, however, try to make it better and more interesting by adding sound effects, photos, movies, etc.
Your completed program should be uploaded to Blackboard before the final session on March 8 (Fri) at 10:00am. In this session, I will distribute the forms for assessment. You will individually fill in the form for other groups' presentations. The grade will be based on the average score of each presentation, which is given by your classmates, and my own assessment.

The key assessment criteria are the following: (1) How much you collected evidences, anecdotes, data, and other materials. You should search for news reports, magazine articles, statistical data, interview results, etc. for your presentation. (2) How deeply you describe and/or analyze the topic of your selection. (3) How well you make a presentation.
Note that you need to pick a topic that is something newsworthy. It does not need to be, however, something very recent.
A Final Paper
You should choose one of the following two options for the final paper (no more than 10 pages excluding references, 12 font, double space), and submit it by March 11 (Monday), 10:00am. Your paper should be a concise, thoughtful and clear piece. Do not write a lengthy and disorganized paper. You should revise it as many times as you can before you finalize it. It is also recommended that you exchange your draft with your classmates and give critical comments to one another.
Option 1: Literature Review
Write a paper that reviews the existing studies on one of the topics covered in the course or any other topic relevant to Japanese politics. You have to use the Social Science Citation Index and library resources and read as many relevant articles and books as you can.
In the literature review, you need to discuss the following questions:
1. What are the central questions examined in these studies? 2. What are the major theories and hypotheses? Any competing
theories/hypotheses? 3. What are the findings? Any competing findings? How convincing are they? 4. What are the problems in the existing studies? 5. What are the questions not fully examined in the literature?
You should NOT answer, however, each of these questions in separate sections or with bullet points. Also, you do not need to review the selected articles one at a time. Rather, compare them as appropriately as you can. You should minimize the number of sentences and words, which you cite from articles, and try to explain and discuss the articles in your own words. In outlining them, you do not need to explain the technical details. (Thus, you do not need to fully understand the statistical details of each paper.) In short, your paper should be a short version of a professional literature review. (See some review articles in Annual Review of Political Science, for examples.)
Your review will be assessed based on (1) how well you accurately describe and compare these articles, and (2) how well you critically evaluate them and develop your own arguments. Feel free to agree or disagree with the selected articles' arguments and/or research designs, but elucidate why you agree or disagree with them.

Option 2: A Research Proposal
Write a research proposal on one of the topics covered in the course or any other topic relevant to Japanese politics. Your research proposal should address the following questions, which are the criteria for assessment:
1. What question do you address? You may formulate an original question, or address a question examined in the existing literature and (propose to re-examine it with new data).
2. Why does it matter? From what literature or real-world events does your question arise? Explain the origins and significance of your research project.
3. What previous literature has been written on your question? Describe the "state of the art" on the subject. Note: Questions 2 and 3 may overlap. You can answer them together in a single statement. You have to use the Social Science Citation Index and library resources and read as many relevant articles and books as you can. You should minimize the number of sentences and words, which you cite from existing studies, and try to explain and discuss them in your own words.
4. What hypothesis will you explore? What is the expected answer (i.e., a hypothesis or an explanation) to your question? If there is one research question, there must be more than one possible answer (i.e., other/alternative hypotheses). Explain what they are and why you think your hypothesis is more plausible than others.
5. How will you test your hypothesis? In other words, how do you design your research (e.g., an original survey in a specific region, a small-scale randomized experiment, the use of existing surveys, comparative case studies, in-depth field research, etc.) to reach your answer? Explain the research design you intend to choose and why you choose it. Various research designs and specific methods for data collection are explained and discussed during this course.
Important: This is just a proposal, so you do not need to collect data and conduct your own research.
Participation (in-class & online)
Students are expected to come prepared to class each session. This means having read and thought about the reading material. The success of this course depends in large part on student willingness to engage in the material and push our conversations up to a higher level. As part of the participation grade, students will also be required to contribute to a group project, as well as online discussions at Blackboard.

MATERIALS AND RESOURCES
Required Readings All the required readings are available on the course Blackboard site for download.
PowerPoint Lecture Slides
PowerPoint lecture slides will be posted to the course Blackboard site after each class. I do not post these before class because note taking is a valuable exercise, and I do not want my slides to substitute for your own notes. Additional Readings
Suggested additional readings are listed at the end of this syllabus and are available at Baker-Berry Library Reserve Services. They are available for your exploration if you are interested in knowing more about a topic. You should try to read some of these, as well as other articles and books not listed in this syllabus, for your assignments. You should familiarize yourself with the Social Science Citation Index to search for articles relevant to a topic of your interest.

x-Period
While I have not scheduled meetings during x-period (except for make-up sessions), I reserve the option to do so if we need extra time to cover the materials on the syllabus. Students should, therefore, not schedule other obligations that conflict with the x-period for this course. If there is no session, students are encouraged to work on their group project and/or individual readings.
Late Submission
Late submissions will be penalized one-third grade per day. If you anticipate that you will have a problem meeting a deadline due to an excusable issue (e.g., family emergency, grave illness, etc.) contact me before the assignment is due to make appropriate arrangements.
Disabilities
Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services are encouraged to see me privately as early as possible in the term. Students requiring disability-related academic adjustments and services must consult the Student Accessibility Services office (301 Collis Student Center, 646-9900, Student.Accessibility.Services@Dartmouth.edu). Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to their professor. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.
Religious Observance
Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
Office Hours
I will be available during the times noted on the first page for meetings with students. If you are unable to meet during these times, please email me to set up an appointment at an alternative time.
