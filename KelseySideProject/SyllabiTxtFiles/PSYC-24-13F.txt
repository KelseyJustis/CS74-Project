Course Objectives
The primary objective of this course is to introduce you to the various forms of psychopathology that can affect a human being. We will examine theories of psychopathology, symptom expression, and our current system of classification. You will also learn about the neurological, psychological, and social mechanisms that contribute to the development and maintenance of psychopathology. Special emphasis will be placed

on understanding the experience of those with mental illness, and on developing critical thinking skills. I also hope that you derive personal benefits from the class; that at the end of the term you will have increased your understanding and acceptance of mental illness, and that you will gain something from this class that will enrich your worldview.
Student Accommodations
In compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, reasonable accommodation will be provided to students with documented disabilities on a case-by-case basis. Students must register with the Office of Academic Support Services and provide appropriate documentation to the College before any academic adjustment will be provided.
Attendance/Participation
Attendance is expected. Lectures expand on information in the text but also include material not covered in the text. If you must miss a class, please arrange to have someone take notes for you.
Reading Assignments
Unless you are specifically told otherwise, you are responsible for reading all of the assigned material. Although the lectures will usually only cover subtopics within each piece of material, all reading and class materials (including handouts and videos) may be covered on exams. It is to your advantage to come to class prepared. This preparation will help you take notes, integrate information, ask more informed questions, and participate in class discussions.
Exams & Quizzes
Two exams will be given. Each exam will have a similar format and will consist primarily of multiple choice. Each exam will cover material presented as part of lectures, videos, and readings. Although some questions will be unique to the text materials (i.e., will not be discussed in lecture), the content assessed by the majority of questions will be discussed in class. The best way to use the text for exam preparation is to be familiar with all of the material, but focus on the overlap between text and lecture topics. You will be given 5 in class "pop quizzes" throughout the semester. Quizzes will be multiple choice, and are designed to encourage you to keep up with the material.
Makeup Exams
Makeup exams will be available for students who provide a valid reason for not being able to take an exam at the scheduled time. This may require official documentation explaining why it was not possible to take the scheduled exam (e.g., a doctor's note). You should inform me of an exam conflict before the exam date. Once approval to reschedule

the exam is given, you should agree on a makeup time with me. I reserve the option to have makeup exams be essay exams.
Grading

Your course grade will be computed as follows:

Quizzes: Exam 1: Exam 2: Final Exam:

10% 30% 30% 30%

Each exam is worth 120 points, and the quizzes are cumulatively worth 40 points. There will be 5 quizzes spaced randomly over the course of the semester. Quizzes will only cover material in your textbook.
