Course Description: This course will survey the major genres of literature found in the Hebrew Bible and Apocrypha. The course will emphasize questions about the composition and development of the various biblical texts against the background of ancient Israel and early Judaism. An important aspect of the course will be to trace the development of key themes and ideas within the different historical and literary strata of the biblical literature, such as the Exodus, Davidic monarchy, exile, temple ideology, and legal traditions. As a result, the course also will give students a basic orientation to the early interpretive traditions of ancient Israel and early Judaism.
Students of all backgrounds, cultures, and faith traditions are encouraged to take this course. Prior knowledge of Judaism or other ancient near eastern religions is not required.
Professors Note: It is not the goal of this course, nor my personal objective, to make you either more or less religious, however it will be important for our discussions that you are open to viewing your own tradition and others from an objective and historical perspective.
Learning Objectives By the end of this course students will:
· Gain a familiarity with the books of the Hebrew Bible and the history of ancient Israel · Receive an introduction into the academic study of ancient religions and religious texts · Be able to interact with the archaeology of ancient Israel as a tool for interpreting the
Hebrew Bible · Be able to critically evaluate the scholarly and traditional interpretations of the Hebrew
Bible
Required Textbooks and Readings: · *The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha: NRSV Other versions of the Bible are acceptable as well (including some online versions, though it will be important to have a Bible that contains the Apocrypha. · John J. Collins, A Short Introduction to the Hebrew Bible (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2007). · William M. Schniedewind, How the Bible Became a Book: The Textualization of Ancient Israel (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004). · Reserve articles and other readings listed in Course Schedule.

Requirements: · Attendance, Reading Responses, and Class Participation (10%). Students will be expected to respond to questions posted to the discussion section of the Rel 4 Blackboard before the class sessions. Students are expected to attend and participate in class sessions. The assigned readings and responses will be completed by the due dates listed in the course schedule. Failure to participate in class discussions will have a negative affect upon a student's final grade. · Exams (75%). Midterm Exam (30%) and Final Exam (45%). The exams will consist of short answer questions, such as multiple choice and term identification, as well as long answer questions. For the purposes of the exam, I would suggest that students read the assigned readings actively, that is, taking notes along the way, especially biblical texts that are highlighted in the secondary reading assignments (Collins, Schniedewind, etc). Students may be permitted to substitute a 2500 word research paper for the final exam. Permission will be granted based on the quality of your earlier writing assignments, your performance on the midterm and the proposed topic of your research. Students will need to consult with me by October 24th to discuss eligibility and provide me with an outline of the paper topic including bibliography by October 27th. · Short Writing Assignments (15%). Each student will write three short response papers that will focus upon close readings of selected biblical texts and the secondary reading assignments. The topics for the writing assignments are: o Writing Assignment #1 -- Creation in Genesis. Assignment will be posted to Blackboard discussion forum by 9/26/14 ! Compare the account of creation in Genesis 1:1-2:3 with the account in Genesis 2:4-3:1. What are the major differences in focus, style, and language between these two accounts? How would you explain the differences between these accounts? How does modern source critical scholarship explain the differences between the accounts? Do you think that there is another way of explaining the differences between the two accounts besides two different authors? For additional help with the assignment see Collins, 75-77. o Writing Assignment #2 -- The Davidic dynasty and biblical literature. Assignment will be posted to Blackboard discussion forum by 10/29/14 ! Describe the ways in which the following biblical texts support and promote the Davidic dynasty and the Promise to David in 2 Samuel 7:117, 1 Kings 1, 1 Kings 11:34-36, 2 Kings 19-20, 2 Kings 23-25. How do these texts allude to or take up the Promise to David in 2 Samuel 7:1-17? How do these texts interpret certain historical events as vindication of the Davidic dynasty? You may want to consult the following secondary sources to help you develop your paper: Collins, 254-257, 295; Schniedewind, How the Bible Became a Book, 73-90. o Writing Assignment #3 -- Critical review and evaluation of How the Bible Became a Book (1-117). 4-6 page critical review due via e-mail by 11/12/14 ! Analysis of Schniedewind's approach to the composition of the biblical texts compared with other modern theories about the composition of the Hebrew Bible. The paper should give a thorough review of the book, followed by a critical comparison of his approach to other approaches (see Collins, 47-65). Students may also consult the extended review of Schniedewind's book in The Journal of Hebrew Scriptures 5/18 (2004-

2005) ­ see specifically David M. Carr, "Response to W.M. Schniedewind's How the Bible Became a Book: The Textualization of Ancient Israel," and Schniedewind's "Adrift: How the Bible Became a Book" response to Carr. You can access these review articles and responses at http://www.jhsonline.org. The review should address the following questions from How the Bible Became a Book: ! What does Schniedewind say is problematic about past approaches to questions about the composition of biblical literature (see especially chapter 1)? ! What does Schniedewind say are the correct types of questions to ask about the composition of the biblical texts? ! What role do questions about orality and textuality play in Schniedewind's approach to the composition of the biblical texts? ! When does Schniedewind place the rise of texts in ancient Israel? ! What evidence does Schniedewind use to support his conclusions for the date of the beginnings of biblical literature in ancient Israel? ! Why does Schniedewind argue that the exilic period was not a period marked by a flourishing of biblical literature?
