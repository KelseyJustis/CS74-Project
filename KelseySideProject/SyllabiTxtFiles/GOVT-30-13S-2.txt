GOVT 30:
Political Misinformation and Conspiracy Theories

Instructor: Prof. Brendan Nyhan Office: Silsby 305 Email: nyhan@dartmouth.edu Phone: 603/646-2894

Classroom: TBD Schedule: TTH 2­3:50 PM x-period: Wed. 4:15­5:05 PM Office hours: Friday 9­11 AM

Overview of the course
Why do people hold false or unsupported beliefs about politics and why are so those beliefs so hard to change? This course will explore the psychological factors that make people vulnerable to political misinformation and conspiracy theories and the reasons that corrections so often fail to change their minds. We will also analyze how those tendencies are exploited by political elites and consider possible approaches that journalists and civic reformers could employ to combat misperceptions.

Instructional approach
Each class period will begin with a brief lecture highlighting and expanding on key points from the readings and answering any questions about them. The remainder of the course period will consist of class discussion and active learning exercises in which we critically examine those ideas.

Learning objectives
By the end of the course, you should be able to:
· Identify the psychological factors that promote belief in misperceptions;
· Explain why conspiracy theories often arise under conditions of stress, danger, or uncertainty;
· Assess the ways in which elites may promote false or unsupported claims;
· Evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches to countering misperceptions and conspiracy theories;
· Assess concerns that widespread belief in misinformation and conspiracy theories undermines democracy.
I expect each student to complete and understand the assigned readings. However, we will aspire to not just learn this material but to take it in new directions, applying theories to new contexts such as current events, drawing

1

connections between the readings, and critiquing authors' assumptions, theories, and findings. The course is structured to help you take these additional steps in your thinking over the course of the quarter.
Course requirements and expectations
Students are expected to complete the assigned reading before each class. You are also expected to follow relevant political news--we will begin each class by discussing misperceptions and conspiracy theories in the news and relating those events to class material. Finally, students must be respectful of others during classroom discussion.
Communication
The class will be run through Blackboard. I will use it to email announcements to you and provide access to assigned readings. Please submit your work to me through its assignments function rather than by email. However, if you have questions, feel free to come to my office hours or email me.
Academic integrity
Students are responsible for understanding the academic integrity rules at Dartmouth. Explanations of integrity rules and principles can be found at http: //www.dartmouth.edu/~uja/. Ignorance of the Academic Honor Principle will not be considered an excuse if a violation occurs. Beyond any penalties imposed as a consequence of an Academic Honor Principle investigation, any student who is found to have cheated or plagiarized on any assignment will receive a failing grade in the class. Details on citing sources are available at http://www.dartmouth.edu/~writing/sources. Please see me immediately if you have any questions or concerns.
Students with disabilities
Students with disabilities enrolled in this course who may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see me before the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Accessibility Services office may be consulted to discuss appropriate implementation of any accommodation requested.
Religious observances
Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your
2

participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
Assignments and grading
Grading in this class will be based on the components described below. In general, each student is expected to attend class on time with the readings completed and to contribute thoughtfully to class discussion when appropriate. Especially thoughtful contributions to class discussion will be taken into consideration when final grades are assigned. I also reserve the right to grade students down for using laptops for any purpose other than taking notes because it often distracts other students. Finally, late work will be graded down 10% for each day it is submitted after a deadline.
Quizzes (10%)
During the quarter, several classes will begin with a one-question quiz intended to determine if you completed the readings (one point will be awarded simply for attending class). Your lowest score during the quarter will be dropped.
Midterms (50%)
The class will include two closed-book in-class midterms (25% each) testing your knowledge and understanding of the readings from that portion of the course. These may include multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short answer questions as well as one or more brief essays.
Project: Understanding and countering misinformation (40%)
Each student will write a paper of 3000­4000 words (excluding references) in which you apply one or more theories from the course to help explain the development and spread of a specific misperception or conspiracy theory and critique the efforts that were made to counter it. You should make a theoretically interesting argument that generates one or more predictions or expectations about the development, timing, spread, or features of the myth and the reasons that fact-checking was ineffective that you can evaluate using historical sources, journalistic accounts, or quantitative data. Make sure to keep the scope of your paper manageable and minimize the space you devote to description and summaries of other people's work--the goal is to make an original argument about a myth or misperception, not to recapitulate other research or recount the history of the myth in exhaustive detail.
In the course of making your argument, your paper should answer these key questions:
1. How can we use the theories in question to understand the spread of the myth?
3

2. Is what we observe consistent with those theories? Why or why not?
3. What implications does this case have for the theories in question (i.e., strengths and weaknesses)? What implications do your findings have for our understanding of the misperception itself?
4. What implications do the theories you have identified have for the effectiveness of the fact-checking tools or content in question? How could those tools or content be improved to better counter misperceptions? (Be specific! Use real examples as case studies and make sure to ground your critique in the readings from the course or other relevant readings from the academic literature.)
5. What conclusions should we draw from your findings about the study of misperceptions more generally?
A draft one-page proposal/outline (including references) is due by 5 PM on April 22. I will either approve your proposal or ask you to submit a revised version. A complete draft including references is due May 13 by 2 PM for peer review. I recommend that you edit the draft after receiving feedback from your colleague and then take the revised version to RWIT for further assistance. The final version of your paper is due by 8 AM on June 3. The rubric that I will use to evaluate your work is provided at the end of the syllabus.
Optional: For students who are interested, the paper can be modified to focus exclusively on critiquing previous fact-checks of a given myth or misperception and explaining how those motivate a new approach to fact-checking. These could include any of the following:
· Conceptual descriptions of new approaches to fact-checking that differ from those of the existing elite fact-checkers (PolitiFact, Factcheck.org, Washington Post Fact Checker)
· Proposals for new online tools to counter misinformation that improve upon or differ from existing efforts (e.g., Truth Goggles, Truth Teller, LazyTruth, etc.)
· Videos demonstrating new concepts for television ad watches (beyond those employed by, e.g., FlackCheck)
If you include a design component, your paper should answer these key questions:
1. What is your design? How would it work? What makes it different from the tools or content that were typically used to address your myth?
2. How is the design of your fact-checking tools or content motivated by theories from the course?
4

3. Why does this approach better address the psychology of misinformation and conspiracy theories than existing fact-checking tools or content?
Articles with substantial video, graphics, or other innovative content may be somewhat shorter than the word limit. (Note: Any such content must be specifically grounded in the relevant literature. Flashy graphics and video for their own sake are not encouraged. Please consult with me if you have questions.)
Course materials
No books are required for this course--all readings are available on Blackboard unless otherwise noted. Note: I will frequently assign blog posts and articles from the popular press to illustrate the points or issues at stake in academic papers. These are labeled "Context and examples" in the schedule below to distinguish them from "Core readings." Both are required but you should devote particular effort to the academic articles, which are typically more difficult to read and understand.
Course schedule
The tentative schedule for the course is presented below. Please note that certain classes have been replaced with x-periods due to holidays and/or schedule conflicts. Two other x-periods will be used for peer review of paper proposals and drafts. Note: This course outline is subject to change; please consult the version of the syllabus on Blackboard for the most up-to-date information.
