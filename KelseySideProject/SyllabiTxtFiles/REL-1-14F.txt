LECTURES: TBD DISCUSSIONS: TBD & TBD

Religion 1 is a comparative study of some of the basic issues of religious thought and some of the basic structures of religious communities. The course is arranged thematically and will focus upon concepts such as myths of creation, religious rituals of initiation, the nature of religious leadership, and concepts of suffering and salvation. Source material for our study will be taken from the literary and artistic resources of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, as well as from other ancient and modern religious traditions.

3. Active participation in weekly discussion sections. Active participation assumes that you will: (1) come to discussion; (2) complete all the assigned readings and/or view all the assigned films before discussion meeting; (3) post responses on Canvas as assigned for each discussion section's readings and/or films; (4) be prepared to discuss the readings, films, and your responses in discussion; and (5) actually speak up during discussion and contribute. Participation also assumes that you will (6) answer a second Discussion Forum question per week, which will be based on one of our lecture class meetings, on Canvas. All class-sessions for which discussion forum responses are required are marked with a double asterisk (**) on the syllabus below. All these factors will be taken into account in determining your participation mark. Participation will count as 20%of your final grade.
4. Please note: Allof the above requirements must be fully completed in order to pass the course.

IV. Other Matters
1. Religious Observances: We realize that some students may wish to take part in religious observances that fall during the term. Should you have a religious observance that conflicts with participation in the course, please come speak with us as soon as possible to discuss appropriate accommodations.
2. Disabilities: Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities who may require disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to see us as soon as possible to discuss your particular needs. All discussions will remain confidential, although we may consult the Student Accessibility Services office to discuss appropriate implementation of any accommodation requested.
3. Illness: Based on our experience over the years, we can report that the #1 predictor of success in REL 1 is to come to class. We urge you, therefore, to attend class on a regular basis. We realize, though, that students may be affected by illnesses that will preclude attendance. We will therefore be putting as much class material as possible (PowerPoints, etc.) on Canvas for review. We know this is an imperfect substitute for actually being present in class, but hope it will be of help nevertheless.
[Note: Exceptional circumstances may require changes  in this syllabus and revision of requirements and assignments.]
