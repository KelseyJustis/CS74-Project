Course Description
Students in this course examine important ideas and trends in contemporary political theory. The course focuses on the works of such theorists as Friedrich Nietzsche, Hannah Arendt, Michel Foucault, and recent advocates of related positions. This course has two aims: first, its object is to foster an understanding of the different writers' conceptions of, inter alia, freedom, persons, power, and action. Second, and more importantly, the course invites students to assess the viability and relevance of the various views considered, with regard to contemporary politics, institutions, and society.

Each of these texts has been ordered and should be available for purchase at Wheelock Books. Required and recommended readings for the course are either contained within the books listed above, or they will be made available by other means. A complete listing of the scheduled readings for Govt. 86.03 is given below.

Format
Govt. 86.03 is a seminar, so it is designed to foster involvement and participation in discussion. Each class will begin with a student presentation on the assigned readings, of 20-25 minutes in duration. The presentations should include the following four elements: (a) introducing the authors (where appropriate); (b) outlining the central arguments and points of interest in the assigned readings; (c) analyzing and critically assessing the material under consideration; and (d) identifying questions that the readings raise, for subsequent consideration. The discussion will then be opened to the seminar as a whole. There is a good deal of reading in Govt. 86.03, but it is crucial that you come prepared, so that you can make use of the seminar discussions. Please also bring the relevant books and other materials with you, when we discuss them, since we will frequently refer to passages in the texts. If there are changes to be made to the syllabus, or adjustments of other kinds, they will be announced in class.

Students' grades will be comprised of the following three components:

(1) In-class presentation on scheduled readings (2) 20-25 page seminar paper (3) Class participation
