Course Description:
World War II transformed the world. In a storm of horrific violence, it brought about the death of millions, destroyed entire cities, and ruined societies and nations. It ended the power of great empires ­ Japan, Germany, France, and Britain ­ while leading to the ascendancy of the United States and the Soviet Union. It unleashed the systematic extermination of the European Jewry, and led to the first deployment of an atomic weapon. The enormous wartime mobilization of human power altered domestic societies, bringing both repression and opportunity. The institutions, international relationships, political processes and technologies fostered by World War II continued to shape the globe for decades.
This course will review the origins, nature, and legacies of this dramatic war. First, we will explore the ideological backgrounds of the war's central participants. How did each regime interpret its place in the world? What were the experiences and ideas that shaped its anxieties, hopes and wartime goals? How did these diverse states perceive their enemies and allies? Second, we will discuss a wide variety of war experiences: what were the distinctions and similarities between the different military theatres? How did soldiers at the front and civilians at home experience the war? How did individuals and societies cope with killing, mass death and sacrifice? Finally, we will explore the legacies of the war: what were the norms, institutions, and memories that followed the war? What were the lessons that various nations drew from this conflict? Drawing on a wide variety of sources, the course will present a multidimensional picture of the complex social, cultural, ideological and political trends that intersected in this monumental conflict.
Course Goals and Requirements:
This course aims to develop a variety of skills: the mastery of facts and concepts; the ability to assess and interpret various sources (both primary and secondary, visual and textual); and ability

2
to express ideas and opinions (both in writing and in class). Your will be assessed on all of these skills. For this purpose, the course includes several different requirements: 1. Participation (20%): Following the first week, Wednesdays will be devoted to discussing the readings. You will be divided into two discussion sections. Students are expected to complete the assigned readings prior to these Wednesday meetings and to attend and actively participate in all discussions.
2. Reading Essay (15%): In the first half of the term, each student must write one essay (up to 1,200 words, about 4 pages, double-spaced) about the readings assigned for one of the first weeks of the course. (During the first week of the term, each student will be assigned to a specific week). Professor Greenberg will assign a question the week before the essay is due. This essay will be due at 7:00 PM on the day before the discussion for the corresponding readings.
3. Midterm Exam (15%): There will be one in-class midterm exam on Thursday, February 7. The exam will consist of identifications and short questions, and will be based on lectures and reading materials.
4. Question Essay (20%): In the second part of the term, each student must write one essay of about 2,000 words (about 6 pages, double-spaced). This essay will be based on questions listed on Blackboard. This paper must be submitted by Sunday, February 24, 7:00 PM.
5. Final exam (30%), consisting of two parts: 1. A 90 minutes in-class exam on Monday, March 11, 11:30 AM. This is worth 15% of your final grade. 2. A take-home essay of up to 1,500 words, due on Wednesday, March 13, 7:00 PM. This is worth 15% of your final grade.

Course Policies
Writing:
All written material should be submitted in 12 point Times New Roman Font, double-spaced, with 1 inch margins. Sources must be cited in footnotes. Submissions are accepted via upload on Blackboard. You may not email me your paper. For guidelines on writing and citing sources, see the short citation guide provided on the course website on Blackboard.
All submitted written material must be your own work and must conform to the Dartmouth honor code (see http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/acad-honor.html). If you have questions about citing the work of others in your paper, please come see me before submitting your work.
Note on late submissions:
Any late submission will be penalized a two-third letter grade (for example, from A- to B). Additionally, late submissions will be penalized another third letter grade for every 12 hours after the initial deadline (for example, from B to B-). If you know you will need an extension, you must contact Professor Greenberg well in advance. Last minute requests will not be approved.
Attendance:
You are expected to attend all classes, both lectures and discussion. If you do miss class, it is your responsibility to get the missed material from a classmate. Any absence from discussion will result in a reduction of the student's overall participation grade. Students who would fail to attend more than two of the discussion sections will result in a zero grade on your participation, and will severely reduce your final grade.
Technology Policy:
All cell phones must be turned off and stowed in your bag for the duration of class. Laptops are allowed during lectures, but must only be used for note taking purposes. No laptops will be allowed on discussion days.
Accommodation:
All students who may need academic adjustments or accommodations during the term are strongly encouraged to convey those needs to me as soon as possible. Early communication is especially important in cases in which students will miss class due to athletic events or religious holidays; it is also important in cases involving disabilities, which may require in-class or other accommodations. During the first week of class, students will be given an opportunity to indicate requests in these areas via an in-class survey; they are also invited to discuss these requests in person and/or via email. All communications will remain confidential, although it may be necessary to consult with the Student Disabilities Coordinator in some cases involving documented disabilities.
