  COURSE GOALS    Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:  *Understand the foundational doctrinal rules and principles that govern relations  among federal, tribal and state governments  *Appreciate the historical context within which the predominate rules and  principles in the field of federal Indian law were developed and enforced  *Critically assess the nature and integrity of rulemaking by governing bodies in  accordance with prevailing constitutional, legal, and moral standards in this field  *Analyze and assess an emerging conflict in the field and propose solutions in  accordance with the relevant and prevailing legal principles  *Discern salient connections between the legal, historical and political  developments in this field and the broader concerns of American constitutional law,  government and history  *Articulate the place of American Indian tribes within America's constitutional  democracy.    COURSE REQUIREMENTS    There are four primary course requirements:  (1) a research paper (40%) (2) a  midterm examination (25%) (3) a final examination (25%) (4) class participation  (10%).    Research Paper:  A research paper of about 15 pages in length (typewritten,  doublespaced, 12 pt. font, exclusive of cover page, endnotes & bibliography) is DUE  ON OR BEFORE 4:00 p.m. TUESDAY, JUNE 3rd (the last day of final exams for  spring term).  More details on paper submissions will be provided later in the term but in  general, papers must be submitted in hard copy (NO email submissions) at Sherman  House by the due date.  NOTE:  Late submissions after the stated deadline will NOT be  accepted in the absence of compelling reasons that are beyond the student's control (e.g.  a sudden and unexpected medical emergency that requires medical treatment for which  documentation is or can be made available).  Students are permitted to write on any topic  related to the course subject matter, whether discussed in class or not.  Suggested paper  topics will be offered early during the term to assist you in developing a topic and thesis.  Papers must have a clearly identified, developed and supported thesis.  Final papers must  include a cover page containing title, student's name, course and date endnotes or  footnotes and a bibliography of sources.  The Dartmouth College Honor Code is in full  effect for all aspects of your research.  Sources must be properly and fully cited.     MidTerm & Final Examination:   These are inclass exams each containing short  essay questions and problemsolving exercises.  The latter problems are typical of law 
2   

school exam questions where students will be presented with hypothetical situations and  asked to provide an analysis of the problem utilizing the body of law developed in the  class.  The midterm examination will take place on Thursday, April 24 during  regular class times.  The final exam will be cumulative, covering the breadth of material  discussed throughout the course.  The final exam period for spring 2014 is May 30   June 3.    Class Participation:  Class attendance is required.  I expect to see enrolled students at  every class absent compelling reasons which require your absence.  I expect students to  have read all assigned materials and come to class prepared to engage in active,  thoughtful and productive discussion.  I expect vigorous, healthy and respectful discourse  on issues raised in class critical analysis, not consensus, is a prime objective of these  discussions.
