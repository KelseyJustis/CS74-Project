Order of Readings:
It is recommended that you read the items for each day in the order that they appear on the syllabus. The readings were deliberately placed in this order -- in many cases, reading the first piece makes reading the next piece easier, and so on.
Class Preparation:
Being prepared for class means doing the readings in advance. Many readings are assigned, but they are often short (the amount of reading for this course was minimized by assigning very specific page numbers to ensure that you are able to make it through all of the material).
Course Evaluation:
Your performance in the class will be based on two in-class midterm exams (40% each) and a final paper (20%).
X-hour:
You are required to leave the "X-hour" free in your schedules. I will not be using the X-hour on a regular basis, but will do so when necessary to make up for cancelled classes.

General Course Policies:
No computers or other electronic devices can be used in class. Cell phones should also be turned off or made silent.
The final paper must be submitted when it is due. Late papers will be lowered by one letter grade per day.
Students with registered disabilities need to inform me sometime during the first two weeks of class.
All students are responsible for understanding Dartmouth's academic integrity rules and principles. Ignorance of these rules and principles is not an excuse if a violation occurs. They can be reviewed at: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/acad-honor.html
