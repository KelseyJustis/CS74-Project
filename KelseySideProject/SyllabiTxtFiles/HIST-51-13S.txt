Course Description:
Over the past two centuries, European culture, society and politics experienced a series of dramatic transformations, changes that unleashed a myriad of intellectual theories and debates. From politics and science to justice and religion, new ideas altered all fields of European thought, as intellectuals sought to understand the turmoil around them. Through a close reading and discussion of European's most influential thinkers from the advent of the Enlightenment to the end of the twentieth century, this course will explore the key concepts that shaped and reflected modern European experiences.
This course has two main goals: first, it will introduce major trends in European thought by exploring how intellectuals of diverse backgrounds--social scientists and philosophers, authors and political theorists--fiercely debated the causes and solutions to major European phenomena of the last two hundred years, including technological revolution, total war, social upheaval, and secularization. In particular, we will explore the ways in which these thinkers sought to explain the relationships between human nature/action and the broader socio-political order. Second, we will consider the ways in which these theories, explanations and ideas intersected with their social, political and cultural contexts. Rather than exploring the history of ideas as an isolated field, we will ask: what were the political, cultural, and/or institutional conditions to which thinkers reacted? How did their theories reflect and shape their surroundings? What were the consequences of their thinking? Toward this goal, the classes will include also discussion of the interactions between thought, society, culture and politics in modern Europe.
Course Goals and Requirements:
This course aims to develop a variety of skills:
1. The mastery of arguments and concepts.

2. The ability to assess and interpret diverse texts. 3. The ability to express ideas and opinions (both in writing and in class).
Your will be assessed on all of these skills. For this purpose, the course includes several different requirements:
1. Participation (30%): all sessions will include both lectures and discussion of assigned texts. As this discussion is integral to this course, students are expected to complete the readings prior to each class meeting, and to participate actively in discussing them in class.
In addition, you are expected to post two questions, thoughts, or comments that you had about the assigned readings for one of the week's three sessions ­ you will be divided in three groups, and each group will be in charge of posting for one of the week's meetings. Those postings are intended to be informal observations to help spark our discussions. They are due at 12:00 AM on the night before class. You must post these under "student postings" on Blackboard, and they will be part of your overall participation grade.
2. Essays (40%; 20% each): throughout the term, each student will write two essays, each 1,700 words (5-6 pages double spaced), choosing from topics provided by Prof. Greenberg. The first paper must be submitted by Sunday, April 14, 7:00 PM, and the second by Sunday, May 12, 7:00 PM.
3. Final take-home essays (30%, 15% each): at the end of the term, each student will write two essays, of 1,500 words each (5-6 pages double spaced), in response to question posted by Prof. Greenberg on Blackboard. The essays will be due on Monday, June 3rd, 1:00 PM.
Course Readings:
The reading for each session will consist one text written by European thinkers. The course's books, which are available both for purchase at Wheelock Books and on Reserve at the library, are:
Jean Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002). John Stuart Mill, On Liberty (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003). Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (New York: Penguin, 2007). Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra (New York: Penguin, 2007). Sigmund Freud, Civilization and its Discontent (New York: Norton, 2000). Carl Schmitt, The Concept of the Political (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007).
The rest of the readings for the course will be available via "Course Materials" on the course's Blackboard website, as well as on Reserve at the library. You are expected to print all the readings and bring them with you to class.

Course Policies
Attendance:
As this is a discussion-based class, you are expected to attend all classes, and third of your grade will determined by your participation. If you do miss class, it is your responsibility to get the missed material from a classmate. Any unexcused absence from discussion will result in a reduction of the student's overall participation grade. Students who would fail to attend more than three classes, for whatever reason, will receive a zero grade on their participation, which will severely reduce their final grade.
Technology policy:
Since this is a discussion-based course, you may not use laptops in this class. You are expected to print the assigned texts and bring them to class.
Writing:
All written material should be submitted in 12 point Times New Roman Font, double-spaced, with 1 inch margins. Sources must be cited in footnotes. Submissions are accepted via upload on Blackboard. You may not email me your paper. For guidelines on writing and citing sources, see the short citation guide provided on the course website on Blackboard.
All submitted written material must be your own work and must conform to the Dartmouth honor code (see http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/acad-honor.html). If you have questions about citing the work of others in your paper, please come see me before submitting your work.
Note on late submissions:
Any late submission will be penalized a two-third letter grade (for example, from A- to B). Additionally, late submissions will be penalized another third letter grade for every 12 hours after the initial deadline (for example, from B to B-). If you know you will need an extension, you must contact Professor Greenberg well in advance. Last minute requests will not be approved.
When submitting a paper via Blackboard, it is your responsibility to make sure that you have uploaded the right file. If you submit an incorrect file (a rough draft instead of a final draft, notes, a different assignment etc.), your essay will be subject to late penalties (applied from the original deadline) until I receive the correct file.
Accommodation:
All students who may need academic adjustments or accommodations during the term are strongly encouraged to convey those needs to me as soon as possible. Early communication is especially important in cases in which students will miss class due to athletic events or religious holidays; it is also important in cases involving disabilities, which may require in-class or other

accommodations. During the first week of class, students will be given an opportunity to indicate requests in these areas via an in-class survey; they are also invited to discuss these requests in person and/or via email.
