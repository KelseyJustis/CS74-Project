General Information

Professor:

Celia Y. Chen, Rm. 126 Class of '78 Life Sciences Center, HB 6044 Celia.Chen@dartmouth.edu

Graduate Teaching Assistant:

Tyler Pavlowich, 112 Fairchild Hall Tyler.T.Pavlowich.GR@dartmouth.edu

Schedule:

Lecture MWF 11:15-12:20 (11-period) X-period, Tuesday 12:00-12:50

Location:

Lectures and X-hours, 105 Life Sciences Center (unless otherwise announced)

Office hours:

C. Chen M 2:00-3:00, W 2:00-3:00 (also by appointment)

T. Pavlowich T 10:45-11:45, Th 1:00-2:00 (also by appointment)

Course purpose:

The overall objective of the course is to examine how abiotic (physical, chemical) and biotic

factors (interactions with other living organisms) shape the ecological characteristics of

organisms in marine ecosystems. We will also examine the role of anthropogenic effects in these

ecosystems and the complexity of the resulting science/policy issues.

Required Books: Textbook: Levinton, 2010, Marine Biology (paperback), Oxford University Press, 3rd Revised International Edition. Reading assignments will be noted on each lecture outline. The pages listed in the lecture schedule below are only tentative assignments for the textbook (Levinton) and do not include additional scientific papers and reports which will be assigned and handed out with each lecture.

Other Books: Sylvia Earle, The World is Blue, 2010, National Geographic. This book is by a world renowned oceanographer and ocean explorer. Based on her vast experience studying and exploring the oceans, this is her personal account of her environmental concerns about the oceans and their resources.

Ray Hilborn, Overfishing: What Everyone Needs to Know, 2012, Oxford University Press. This book is by a very well known fisheries biologist at the University of Washington. It breaks down in very basic terms the complex issues of overfishing.

X-period: X-Hours will be used for lectures and films. Film content will be covered in exams. Students are welcome to bring their lunches to class on those days.

Hourly Exams: 2 hourly exams and a final exam (1st: 20%, 2nd: 25%, 3rd: 30%). For each exam, 90% of the content will be from lectures and required readings, 10% from films and discussions. Exam format (10-15 short essays). The final exam will not be cumulative.

Field Trip: Location Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole MA, and Waquoit National Estuarine Research Reserve, Falmouth MA. Saturday to Sunday, May 4th (6AM) to 5th (6PM) The field trip will have three components: 1) going out on the research vessel, the Gemma, to sample for marine organisms; 2) Visit the Marine Resources Center (MBL) where marine organisms are cultured for ecological and biomedical research; 3) Plant identification and data collection on a local salt marsh.
Writing Assignment: There will be a writing assignment involving research on a marine biology research topic of your choice. The assignment will involve investigating primary scientific literature on a topic of interest to you and developing a set of testable questions based on and supported by the current state of the research. The investigation will culminate in a short paper written in the style of an introduction to a scientific paper. The assignment will be due in the middle of the term and comprise 15% of the final grade.
Required Reading and Class Discussions: The book, The World is Blue, will be the focus of our discussions in the first half of the term. There will be assigned readings from the book and subsequent class discussions on marine science topics with policy relevance. Students will be required to hand in discussion questions prior to the class and be prepared to participate in a discussion.
Overfishing: What Everyone Needs to Know This book will be the focus of a class discussion and a starting point for talking about the interaction between fisheries and science in the second half of the course. These same types of issues pertain to most commercially caught species in the oceans. We will have a class discussion on the science and the policy issues concerning one of the fisheries.
Group Presentations: There will be student group presentations on the scientific and policy issues surrounding three different fisheries. In each topic area, groups of students will represent industry, environmental advocates, or government regulators. Groups will turn in a summary of the major points of their presentation that will comprise 5% of the final grade. All students will be responsible for material presented by all of the groups.

GENERAL COURSE ISSUES

Special Accommodations: "Students requiring disability-related accommodations must register with the Student Accessibility Service office. Once SAS has authorized
accommodations, students must show the originally signed SAS Accommodations/Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to their professor. As a
first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions about
accommodations will remain confidential."

Religious Observances: Students may wish to take part in religious observances that fall during this academic term. Should you have a religious observance that conflicts with
your participation in the course, please come speak with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

Athletic Obligations: While it is important for students to meet their commitments to their athletic teams, it is also their responsibility to meet their academic ones. When missing class for athletic events, it is highly recommended that students meet with me or the TA, Tyler Pavlowich, to make up material covered in the lecture.
Honor Code: As with all courses, you are expected to follow the guidelines of Sources, Their Use and Acknowledgment that can be found on the internet at www.dartmouth.edu/~sources/. The sections most relevant to this course are in the section, "What is plagiarism?" Citation formats for papers and projects will be discussed in class.
