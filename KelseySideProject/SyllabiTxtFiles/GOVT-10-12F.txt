Course Objectives: Political scientists use quantitative methods to study a wide variety of research questions. Having a basic understanding of quantitative methods is essential to be able to engage with some of the big empirical debates in political science such as "Are democracies less likely to go to war with each other?", "Do sanctions work?" or "Is the American electorate becoming more polarized?"
This course is intended to give students an introduction to some of the more fundamental statistical methods used by political scientists. The course covers various methods for exploratory data analysis before moving on to some simple hypothesis tests and then regression analysis. We will also discuss some basic principles of research design and causal inference. The course will focus on developing the following skills:  understanding the basics of probability theory  identifying the strengths and weaknesses of different research designs  collecting and analyzing your own data  running a regression analysis in STATA (or R)  interpreting the results of regression analyses published in leading journals in political
science

Expectations: The main component of the assessment will be in the form of exams -- a midterm (30% of overall grade) and a final (40% of overall grade). Exams will be traditional in-class, blue-book exams. We will conduct a detailed review of the midterm exam in the first class meeting after the exam.
10% of your overall grade will be based on your performance on regular homework exercises. Short problem sets will be assigned on most class meetings and will be due at the start of the next class meeting. The problem sets will be graded on a simple Satisfactory/Not Satisfactory scale, with an exceptional grade of S+ for perfect solution sets.

The remaining 20% of your grade will be based on a group research project. This is the part of the course where you'll have the opportunity to put the concepts covered in the course into practice in a real-life setting. The goal of the exercise is to pick any social science question of interest to you and design a study that helps answer that question using one or more of the methods covered in this course. Your grade will depend upon the quality of your research design and analysis and not on the substantive findings themselves. In other words, you won't be penalized if your analysis is strong but the evidence you collect turns out not to support your theory. Each group should write up the results of their project in the form of a poster presentation for display in the final class meeting.
Important Dates and Deadlines:  Midterm exam: Wednesday October 10, in class.  Post-midterm review session: Friday October 12.  Project presentations: Monday November 12, location t.b.a.  Final exam: Friday November 16, 8:00am, location t.b.a.

Reading Schedule: Please note that the following schedule gives the order in which we'll cover the material, but not the specific dates on which we'll cover them. I've kept it flexible to allow us to advance through the material at a pace that suits the specific needs of the students in the class. At the end of each class meeting I'll tell you what to read (and which problems to attempt) before the next class.
