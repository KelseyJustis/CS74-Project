Socy 049 -- Sociology of Culture
Prof. Goodman MWF 12:30-1:35

Course Description: Every society is made up of human beings, but most societies are able to endure beyond the lifespan of every one of their current members. As each new member is brought into this society, they are exposed to meaningful objects that help to orient the new member to their society. For the purposes of this class, those meaningful objects are what we mean by culture.
Culture can refer to religious books read from the pulpit, art hanging in a museum, stories told at bedtime, songs heard on the radio, movies, novels, icons, manners, speech habits and much more. Culture is anything that has meaning and that can be passed on to subsequent generations. You have inherited a culture and you will pass one on to the next generation. The aim of this class is to help you to analyze the culture that you have inherited and to critically evaluate the culture that you intend to pass on.

Readings: All readings will be posted as pdf files on Blackboard. There are no books to buy. If you have any problems downloading the readings, please let me know immediately.

Grades: Your grade will be determined according to the following formula:

Reading Points Reading Point Tests Large & Small Culture Paper Ritual Paper Ethnography of Games Paper Music Production Paper

10% 20% (2 x 10%) 15% 15% 15% 25%

Incompletes will only be given when the student is otherwise passing the course and cannot complete it due to circumstances that are unforeseen and beyond the student's control.

Reading Points: For each reading, I will provide a set of questions that you should be prepared to answer when called on in class. Only students called on in class will be graded on that day. If you are absent the day that I call on you without a university defined excuse, you will receive an 'F'. Since each student is likely to be called on only 5 or 6 times, it is important that you be prepared for every class. I will give everyone one 'free pass' for the term on reading points. In other words, you can let me know that you will be unprepared to answer the application points for that day. However, you must do this before class starts, either by email, in person, or phone. You will not be given a free pass after I have called on you.

Reading Point Tests: At the midterm and at the time of the final, you will write out the answers to 4 of the reading points that have been assigned. The final test will not be cumulative. If you have As on all in class reading points, you may drop the final reading point test.

Written Assignments: There will be four written assignments for this class. Large & Small Culture Paper: A 6-8 page paper using class readings to analyze an assigned
piece of art. Ritual Paper: A 4-5 page paper using class readings to analyze an assigned ritual. Ethnography of Games: A 6-8 page paper using class readings and ethnographic observation to
analyze a game of your choice. Music Production Paper: A 10-12 page paper using class readings, ethnographic observations
and library research to analyze a piece of music of your choice. More complete descriptions of this assignment and the criteria for grading will be posted on Blackboard.

Help: I will hold office hours on Monday, Wednesday & Friday from 11:05-12:30 and from 1:30 to 2:30 on Monday and Wednesday. My office is in room 105 Silsby. I can also be reached by phone or email. I check my email often every day and it is my preferred mode of communication. My home phone is 857.399.6137. Messages can also be left for me in the Sociology office.
Please let me know if you have any disabilities which will affect your participation in this class. I will make every effort to accommodate you.
