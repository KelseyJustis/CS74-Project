Description: This course is an introduction to the study of politics among states and other actors on the world stage. Its purpose is to help you develop the analytical skills and knowledge you need to think critically about international affairs. You will be introduced to the methods and models of international relations theory, quantitative and qualitative data about modern international politics, and critical aspects of contemporary statecraft. The course begins with a review of the main theories for understanding and explaining international relations. It then seeks to help you use these theories to analyze the major substantive areas of international relations: international security (war & peace); international organization and law; foreign policy analysis; and the global economy. The course features an intensive simulation exercise designed to explore seemingly abstract theoretical propositions about international relations in an intense interactive setting. The last section of the course addresses salient current issues such as the global environment, human rights, humanitarian intervention, and the future of U.S. grand strategy.

Learning Goals: The larger purpose of the course is to help you become a more sophisticated, knowledgeable and critical thinker about international relations. Beyond the basic but important goal of conveying basic information about international relations (e.g., how the UN Security Council or the World trade Organization works), the course aims to:

1. Enhance your understanding of the big questions in the study of international politics. Why do actors go to war instead of resolving their differences peacefully? Why don't states and other international actors cooperate to solve common problems when it appears clearly in their interest to do so? 2. Enhance your ability to think in the abstract i.e. theoretically. 3. Sharpen your reading skills. The goal of your reading should not be to finish the article or the chapter. Instead it should be to prepare yourself to think critically and originally about the questions, theoretical claims, evidence, and implications of the material you have read. 4. Practice generating implications (theoretical, empirical, policy) from theoretical priors/concepts. 5. Enhance your understanding of how to use data to test conjectures about how international politics works.

Requirements: Major course exercises will count toward your grade as follows:

·Two in-class exams ·In-class quizzes ·Final take-home essay ·Simulation

60% (2@30% ea.) 5% 35% (see text below)

Exams will draw in roughly equal parts from readings and lectures. In-class exams will be given on Friday Oct. 5 and Monday Nov. 5 Quizzes: Attendance in class is mandatory. In order to encourage attendance and timely completion of the reading assignments, there will be a number of short unannounced quizzes based on the readings. These quizzes have been designed so that most students who have completed the reading should receive full credit (in other words, the quizzes will be very easy if you did the reading but close to impossible if you have not). Short paper: A hard copy of the final take home exercise is due to the Government Dept. Office (211 Silsby) by 4 PM on the day the Registrar designates for this course's final exam Simulation: All students are required to participate in an intensive international crisis simulation focusing on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (with a special meeting on Saturday, October 27). As part of the simulation, each student will be required to produce a brief (750-word) memorandum on a topic to be assigned. Failure to participate fully in the simulation will result in a deduction of up to 15 percentage points from your final course grade. Extraordinary participation may be rewarded by an increase in your final grade of up to 5 percentage points. Students who cannot participate in the simulation must notify me at least 2 weeks in advance and will receive an alternate assignment. Readings: All readings are available on-line in PDF format through the course web page (blackboard) under the "course materials" button. Course Policies: Make-up exams or extensions will not be granted except in case of emergency and in all cases require a note from your class Dean and/or from Dick's House. Late work will be penalized. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in this course, please contact me before the end of the second week to discuss appropriate accommodations. If you have a registered disability and require accommodations, please contact me immediately so that we may discuss them. All students are responsible for understanding Dartmouth's academic integrity rules. These rules and principles can be reviewed at: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/acad-honor.html and http://www.dartmouth.edu/~sources/
