Socy 079--Drugs and Pharmaceuticals in Society
Prof. Goodman MWF 10:00-11:05
Course Description: Licit and illicit drugs make illuminating case studies for our economic and political systems. We investigate the following questions: Are profit motives and humanitarian concerns in irresolvable conflict? Does the international network of illegal drugs show the future of globalization? Does pharmaceutical lobbying demonstrate the anti-democratic influence of money? Is the "war on drugs" political demagoguery or a rational response to human weakness? We will use readings, papers and discussions to explore these questions.

Grades: Your grade will depend on the following formula:

Reading Points Dartmouth Policy Analysis Economic Analysis Paper Politics & Law Analysis Paper

10% 30% (Due 10/10) 30% (Due 11/3) 30% (Due at Finals)

Incompletes will only be given when the student is otherwise passing the course and cannot complete it due to circumstances that are unforeseen and beyond the student's control.

Readings: All readings will be posted as pdf files on Blackboard. There are no books to buy. If you have any problems downloading the readings, please let me know immediately.

Reading Points: I will provide reading points on Blackboard for most assignments. You will be graded on your ability to provide a summary of the author on those points when called on in class. Only students called on in class will be graded on that day. If you are absent the day that I call on you without a university defined excuse, you will receive an 'F'. Since each student is likely to be called on only 4 or 5 times, it is important that you be prepared for every class. I will give everyone one 'free pass' for the term on reading points. In other words, you can let me know that you will be unprepared to answer the reading points for that day. However, you must do this before class starts, either in person, phone message or email. You will not be given a free pass after I have called on you.

Help: I will hold office hours on Monday, Wednesday & Friday from 11:05-12:30 and from 1:30 to 2:30 on Monday and Wednesday. My office is in room 109 Silsby. I can also be reached by phone or email. I check my email often every day and it is my preferred mode of communication. My home phone is 857.399.6137. Messages can also be left for me in the Sociology office.
Please let me know if you have any disabilities which will affect your participation in this class. I will make every effort to accommodate you.
