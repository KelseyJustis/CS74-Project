Course Description: Most of modern life takes place within a wide variety of complex, interconnecting organizations, from multi-national corporations to churches, social service agencies to volunteer organizations. In this course we will learn about the structure, internal processes, and environments of different forms of organization. We will analyze how organizational features affect individual behavior, and vice versa. We will also consider how organizations affect social outcomes, and the basic structure of society. We will look at a wide variety of organizations, including corporations and voluntary organizations, schools, hospitals, and NGOs. Our objectives will be to learn the various ways sociologists and others have addressed these questions through theory and research, as well as to conduct our own observations of organizations.

This class is designed as a seminar, so class time is devoted to discussion between and among students and the instructor, as well as lectures. It is essential that seminar participants come to class prepared to discuss the reading material for that day's class. Participants are expected to not only read, but also reflect upon the assigned readings before coming to class.

You will choose an organization in which you are (or were recently) a member. Throughout the term you will write eight 3-page papers analyzing different aspects about your chosen organization (see attached assignment sheet). In addition to papers there will be three quizzes during the term (10% each).

Grades are determined, based on: Organizational analysis papers 3 Quizzes

70% (see attached assignment sheet) 10% each

Honor Principle and work in this course: (1) Papers. You are encouraged to discuss your papers with other students in the class, but the writing is to be your independent work. You should cite concepts and materials from class appropriately in your papers, though it is possible that some papers will not have any citations.

(2) Quizzes are independent work ONLY. You are encouraged to study with other students from class, but quizzes are completely independent work.

Policy on Late Papers
Papers or other assignments handed in after the due date and prior to the next class period following the due date will receive a full letter grade reduction. (Basically this means the highest possible grade you can get on a late paper is a B.) I will deduct an additional half a letter grade for each additional class period your paper is late. (That means, if you hand a paper in one week after the assigned due date, or two class periods late, the highest grade you can receive on the paper is a B-).
Any assignment more than two weeks late will not be accepted. Extensions may be given for extreme individual circumstances. If you are having problems with an assignment, for whatever reason, it is best to talk with me as soon as possible, BEFORE the paper is due. Talk to me! I may be able to help you get the paper done on time, and I will be more sympathetic than if I hear of your problem the day before or day (!) the assignment is due.
Please Note Well: YOU are responsible for any file errors. Papers that I cannot open will be considered late.
