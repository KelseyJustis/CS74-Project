      COURSE  DESCRIPTION   How  do  we  learn?  How  can  modern  educational  settings  harness  recent  innovations   concerning  the  essence  of  human  learning?  Educational  psychology  provides  a   foundation  for  applying  the  psychological  principles  that  underlie  learning  in  both  formal   and  informal  educational  settings.  In  this  course,  we  will  explore  the  multitude  of  ways   that  people  learn,  the  effects  of  different  types  of  teaching  strategies  on  learning,  and  the   impact  of  individual  differences  on  learning.  We  will  also  explore  assessment,  creativity   and  problem  solving,  as  well  as  cultural  and  motivational  influences  on  learning  across   diverse  educational  situations.  Underlying  the  course  will  be  an  account  of  the  way  the   human  mind  works,  changes,  and  adapts  in  different  settings.  This  includes  the  home,   the  school,  the  university  and  any  context  in  which  explicit  or  implicit  education  takes   place.         COURSE  GOALS   This  course  challenges  students  to  think  critically  about  the  relationship  between  what   we  know  about  the  mind  from  experimental  research  and  how  we  teach  students  to  learn   in  actual  classroom  settings.    In-class  discussion  of  assigned  readings  is  a  critical   component  of  this  course.    We  will  discuss  such  topics  as  how  people  learn,  how   knowledge  is  stored  and  organized  in  the  mind,  how  schools  have  used  and  could  use  the   findings  of  psychological  research  to  improve  student  learning,  and  what  should  be  the   aims  of  the  fields  of  Educational  Psychology  and  Educational  Neuroscience.    Developing   the  skills  of  critically  reading  empirical  research  articles  and  writing  a  research  paper  are   central  to  achieving  these  course  goals.         GRADING  OVERVIEW   15%     Class  Presentations  (2)  &  Participation   12%     Short  Opinion  Paper   20%   Final  Research  Paper   20%   Midterm  Examination   33%   Final  Examination

GENERAL  POLICIES   1. Read  all  materials  and  prepare  for  class.    You  are  expected  to  read  the   materials  posted  on  Blackboard  before  each  class.    Be  prepared  to  discuss  that   material  in  class.  Everyone  is  expected  to  come  to  every  class  and  to  arrive  on  time.     You  are  also  expected  to  contribute  to  class  discussion.    You  will  learn  the  material   better  and  others  will  learn  from  you.    The  success  of  this  course  depends  on   everyone  coming  to  class  prepared  and  ready  to  discuss  the  material.  Both   attendance  (on-time)  and  preparation  for  class  will  determine  a  portion  of  your   grade  (see  "Assignments  and  Assessments"  below).       2. Tell  me  sooner  rather  than  later.    If  you  know  ahead  of  time  that  you  will  be   missing  a  class,  e.g.,  for  sports  or  religious  observance,  please  let  me  know  in   advance  in  order  to  avoid  losing  course  credit.     3. ASSUME  THAT  I  WILL  NOT  ACCEPT  LATE  ASSIGNMENTS.   4. Cell  phones  are  not  to  be  used  in  class.  If  an  emergency  arises  that  requires  the   use  of  a  phone,  please  quietly  excuse  yourself  from  the  room  to  respond.       5. Accommodations.  Students  with  learning,  physical,  or  psychiatric  disabilities   enrolled  in  this  course  who  may  need  disability-related  classroom   accommodations  are  encouraged  to  make  an  office  appointment  to  see  me  early  in   the  semester  (i.e.,  within  the  first  two  weeks).  If  you  have  not  done  so  already,   students  requiring  disability-related  accommodations  should  register  with  the   Student  Accessibility  Services  office  regarding  Dartmouth's  policies  and  available   resources:  http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/   6. Plagiarism  is  unacceptable.    All  work  submitted  as  your  own  must  be  written  by   you  and  not  previously  submitted  for  any  other  class.  It  is  important  to  attribute   material  that  is  the  work  of  others  to  the  original  source.  If  you  are  unsure  how  to   properly  cite  a  source,  please  consult  with  me  prior  to  handing  in  an  assignment.     You  should  be  familiar  with  Dartmouth's  Academic  Honor  Principle,  which  applies   to  all  courses  at  Dartmouth  (available  here:  www.dartmouth.edu/~uja/honor/  ).  I   do  not  expect  any  violations  of  this  code,  but  if  any  concerns  do  arise  I  will  forward   all  related  materials  to  Dartmouth's  Committee  on  Standards.   7. Before  you  turn  in  your  papers...  make  sure  that  you  use  12-point Times New Roman font,  that  you  double-space  the  whole  document,  that  your  print  margins   are  1-inch  on  all  sides  (not  the  default  in  Word),  that  all  your  pages  are  numbered,   and  that  your  document  is  stapled  together  (if  printed).    For  citations  in  all  papers,   you  must  use  APA  Style  formatting  (refer  to  the  APA  Style  Manual  or  online   guides,  such  as:    http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/  )
