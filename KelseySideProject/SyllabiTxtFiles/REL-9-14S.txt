Course Description
This is an introductory course on the Hindu religious tradition of India. No background knowledge is required or presumed.
The term "Hinduism" is really an umbrella category used to refer to the family of religious traditions characteristic of the Indian subcontinent. This means that in comparison to other religions, Hinduism is extraordinarily diverse in nature, spanning a time-period of over 3,000 years and covering a wide geographical area characterized by dozens of languages, cultures, communities, and ethnic groups, and a bewildering variety of doctrines, beliefs, and practices. Within the limits of this course, it is impossible to study the full variety of religious expressions in such a vast area and over such a long period of time. We will focus on the major doctrines, practices, and institutions characteristic of the cluster of religious traditions we today call "Hinduism," taking a historical and chronological perspective that begins in 2500 B.C.E. and moves down to the present day.

Attendance, Preparation, and X-Hours
Class attendance is obligatory, and I expect you to attend on a regular basis, as well as to have the reading assignment completed beforehand. In some cases, the reading assignment will include your viewing of a film (on streaming video), which should also be completed beforehand. Please be aware that we will be using three of our X-hours this term.

Required Texts
All required texts are available for purchase at both the Dartmouth Bookstore and Wheelock Books, and available on 2-hour reserve at Baker-Berry. The Religion 9 Source Book, which is also required, is available for purchase only at Wheelock Books.
Thomas J. Hopkins, The Hindu Religious Tradition -- (Note: Unfortunately, this book is quite expensive. I have asked both bookstores to stock as many used copies as possible, and I

would prefer you to buy the book, if you are able to obtain a used copy. Do not buy a new copy; it's too expensive. In addition, however, I have also placed four copies on 2-hour reserve at the library. If you are unable to buy the book, I would strongly suggest that you borrow a reserve copy as soon as possible and xerox all of the pages we'll be reading throughout the term. This will save you from having to check the book out repeatedly. The pages you will need are: 3-27, 36-63, 73-86, 90-95, 108-112, 121-124, and 131-134.)

Grading Criteria
(1) BLACKBOARD RESPONSES. Beginning with the second class-session (on March 26), there are 22 class-sessions (marked with an asterisk on the syllabus below) for which you may choose to submit a response to the readings on Blackboard. You are expected to submit 16 out of the 22 possible responses throughout the course of the term; any fewer than 16 responses will begin to lower this portion of your grade. Responses are due by 6:00 am on the morning of the relevant class and will not be accepted late under any circumstances. Your response should be one decent-sized paragraph long and may pertain to any aspect of one or more of the readings or films assigned for that day. You may use your response to reflect upon a point from the readings/films, raise a question that was left unanswered, express a personal opinion or reaction relating to the content of the readings/films, relate a point from the readings/films to outside material, etc. But in all cases, your response should reflect your careful engagement with the assigned readings/films. Responses will be graded on a check-minus, check, checkplus basis. Blackboard responses are worth 20% of the final grade.
To submit your responses on Blackboard: On the course Blackboard site, go to "Responses," click on the appropriate class day, click on "Create Thread," enter a title for your response under "Subject," enter your response in the box marked "Message," and then click "Submit." Blackboard will record the date and time when you submit your response.
(2) SHORT PAPERS. There will be two short paper assignments (5 pages each) asking you to critically engage selected topics we have covered. The first paper assignment will be handed out in class on Monday, April 7, and due back (via Blackboard) by 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, April 16. The second paper assignment will be handed out in class on Friday, May 9, and due back (via Blackboard) by 5:00 p.m. on Monday, May 19. Both paper assignments will be based on the readings you have done and will require no additional reading. Each short paper is worth 20% of the final grade, for a total of 40%.
(3) MIDTERM & FINAL EXAMS. There will be an in-class midterm exam on Friday, April 25. It will be cumulative, covering material from the beginning of the course up to the class before the midterm. There will be a final exam at 8:00 AM on Friday, May 30 (as scheduled by the Registrar). It will focus on material covered after the midterm but include questions that
2

require a basic comprehension of the material covered in the whole course. Both exams will consist of short-answer and/or essay questions on the central themes of the lectures and readings. Critical thinking and clear writing will be essential to receiving a good grade. Each exam is worth 20% of the final grade, for a total of 40%.
(4) MAKE-UP POLICY. Blackboard responses may not be turned in late under any circumstances. Short papers may be turned in late only if you have a decent reason for doing so and have made arrangements with me for an extension beforehand. The midterm exam may be taken at an alternative time only if you have a very good reason and have made arrangements with me beforehand. There will be no possibility of making up the final exam (aside from something like serious medical illness or a death in the family), although taking the final exam early may be possible if you arrange it with me beforehand.
(5) SUMMARY OF GRADING SYSTEM: Blackboard Responses (20%); Short Paper No. 1 (20%); Short Paper No. 2 (20%); Midterm Exam (20%); Final Exam (20%).
(6) DISABILITY ACCOMMODATIONS & RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES. If you have a learning disability or any other condition that will require accommodation on my part, or if you will miss class because of a religious observance, please give me plenty of advance warning.
(7) SYLLABUS CHANGES. I reserve the right to change any aspect of this syllabus at my discretion (but I will, of course, inform you of such changes ahead of time).
Course Syllabus
Note: For the most part, "Reading No. 1," "Reading No. 2," etc., refer to numbered readings in the Religion 9 Source Book. Some of these numbered readings, however, are posted on Blackboard instead (as noted below). Therefore, there will be gaps in the numbered readings in the reader. There are also other readings on Blackboard (which were added to the course later) that are not numbered.
