DARTMOUTH COLLEGE Nelson A. Rockefeller Center

Public Policy 43/Economics 77 Social Entrepreneurship

Professor Andrew Samwick Summer 2014

Course Description:

Public Policy 43/Economics 77 provides an introduction to the theory and practice of social entrepreneurship, defined generally as the process of finding innovative, sustainable solutions to social problems and, more specifically for this course, social problems that are a cause or consequence of poverty.

Course Objectives:

The course has three objectives. First, students will understand the nature and causes of poverty, in both domestic and international contexts, as well as the emergence of social entrepreneurship as a means of addressing poverty. Second, students will learn about the process of social innovation and the way social entrepreneurs have transformed those innovations into poverty-relieving initiatives. Third, as a means of experiential learning, students will build on the first two objectives to identify manageable aspects of the larger problem of poverty and to propose, refine, and pitch a venture to address that aspect.

It is expected that the best of these ventures will be eligible for continued support from the Rockefeller Center and for additional development in the new campus Innovation Center.

This course serves either as a "Policy Methods Course" for the Public Policy Minor or as a course, not part of a sequence, in the Economics Major or Minor.

Prerequisites: Economics 1 and one course conveying quantitative or qualitative research methods. Options include: Public Policy 10, Economics 10, Government 10, Mathematics 10, Psychology 10, Sociology 10, Mathematics and Social Sciences 15, Geography 11, Geography 50, Sociology 11, or Education 11.

Course Readings:

The following three books are required. They are available at Wheelock Books and at Amazon.com using the links below. The first will serve as a textbook for the course, laying out the intellectual framework to understand the process and impact of social entrepreneurship. The second focuses the work of Muhammad Yunus, whose pioneering work in microfinance in Bangladesh helped launch and define the field of social entrepreneurship and was honored with the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. The third provides a more general overview of the field of social entrepreneurship as it has developed, including what differentiates social entrepreneurship from the work of the more traditional private sector, the non-profit sector, and the public sector.

Review the material from your Economics 1 course on "Supply and Demand," "Market Efficiency," "Externalities," and "Inequality and Poverty." If you used the Principles of Economics textbook by Mankiw, these are Chapters 4, 7, 10, and 20. A copy of this textbook is on Reserve.

Sections of these books are referred to in the Course Outline below by the last name of the author highlighted in bold. All other readings are listed in the Course Outline, along with links to where they may be downloaded from any Dartmouth computer.

Many of these other readings are business cases. Learning about entrepreneurship, particularly learning that will lead to a new entrepreneurial venture, happens by studying examples of past successes and failures. These cases have been selected because they address general principles common to all ventures or they illustrate a style of innovation that could be applied for social entrepreneurship. All cases will be available for purchase as a set directly through Harvard Business School Publishing.

Course Grading:

Your grade in the course is determined by your participation in classroom discussions and your performance on writing, research, and speaking assignments. For students who complete all of the assignments, the final course grade will be determined based on those assignments as follows:

Class Participation: Homework Assignments: In-Class Exam: Business Model:

15% 20% 20% 45%

Version 05/01/2014

1) Class Participation
Class participation consists of your contributions to the discussion and analysis of social entrepreneurship during the class period. To do well in this aspect of the course, you must come to class having done the assigned reading and any other preparatory assignments and having thought about how the material in the reading and assignments relates to the larger objectives of the course.
2) Homework Assignments
There will be short homework assignments due at the start of most class periods. These assignments will consist of a few questions drawn from the assigned reading and relevant to the In-Class Discussions or Exercises. They ensure that you are keeping up with the assigned reading, come to class prepared to contribute to discussions, and develop the analytical skills and creative processes that will enable you to put together your own business model.
3) In-Class Exam
There will be one exam in the course, scheduled for the class period of August 5, covering the lectures, discussions, and homework assignments on poverty, innovation, and social entrepreneurship.
4) Business Model
For this project, you will work in teams of 2-3 students to develop and present a business model for a social enterprise that generates net income for those in poverty or increases the purchasing power of low-income households by reducing the cost of a product or service on which they typically spend money. This assignment will require you to research the need for the enterprise's product or service and the latent customer demand for the product or service; to design a product or service that draws from the class discussions of innovation; and to present your business model in both written and oral form. Both presentations will be uploaded to a website for your enterprise and can serve as the basis for subsequent work to launch your idea.
Due Dates for this project:
Wednesday, July 30, 5:00 p.m.: Latest time to submit an outline of the business idea. Wednesday, August 13, 5:00 p.m.: Latest time to submit rough drafts of the project. Tuesday, August 19: Oral presentations of projects during class period. Thursday, August 21, 5:00 p.m.: Latest time to submit final drafts of the project.
Your grade on this assignment is a combination of your grades on the rough draft (20%), the oral presentation (30%), and the final draft (50%).

Additional Information:
Class Meetings: Rockefeller 2 [to be confirmed], TTh 2:00 ­ 3:50 p.m. (x-period W 4:15 ­ 5:05 p.m.). No use of the X-period is planned for this term, but students are expected to keep the X-period open in case it is needed. You should check with me before taking on an obligation that would conflict with any X-period should it be needed.
There are two meetings outside of regularly scheduled class meetings that all students must attend:
1. On June 20 ­ 21, the whole class will participate in The Startup Experience, a two-day workshop that helps students to build creative capacity and entrepreneurial confidence and to find inspiration for future ventures. The workshop lasts from the late afternoon on Friday, June 20, to the late afternoon on Saturday, June 21, and is open to the whole Dartmouth community.
2. On August 19, the last day of class, we will have oral presentation of business models. You should expect to stay beyond the end of class to ensure that all teams have an opportunity to present to the whole class. We will have a celebratory dinner when all presentations are finished.
Office Hours: Rockefeller 112, Wednesdays, 2:00 ­ 4:00 p.m. Regular office hours are on a walk-in basis. If you need to see me at other times, please schedule an appointment through e-mail. I can also be available for office hours via Google Hangouts some evenings.
Honor Principle: Students are expected to follow the College's guidelines for the proper attribution of sources in the conduct of their own research. While offering assistance to fellow classmates is encouraged, all written, oral, and computer assignments that are not group-based are expected to reflect each student's own individual work. All in-class, graded assignments will be timed and done without reference to books, notes, or computers unless otherwise specified. Any student referring to such materials or giving or receiving assistance during a graded assignment violates the Academic Honor Principle.
Equal Access: Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities who may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment as soon as possible. The Academic Skills Center will be asked to verify that the student is approved for these services. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Disabilities Coordinator may be consulted to discuss appropriate implementation.
Religious Observances: Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
