Examinations

The midterm (65 minutes) counts for 15% of your grade. The final (180 minutes), covering the entire course with greater emphasis on the latter half, counts for 25%. Weekly homework counts for 35% of your grade. Lab reports for 25%.

Lab Reports

Due 12 noon the MONDAY after lab activity at P16 lab return box (clearly marked down by front doors under students mailboxes) [penalty for late work: 10% of grade/day]

Homework Given in class every Friday and due at 12 noon next FRIDAY at P16 homework box (main entrance hall).

Honor Principle

Adherence to the Honor Principle means that you will write your own exams (closed book) without assistance and write up the labs and term essay (if applicable) by yourself. The essay should be properly documented (see Sources: Their Use and Acknowledgment, 1998, http://www.dartmouth.edu/~sources). Otherwise, we encourage you to work together in the labs and in studying for the exams.

Special Situations

Students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases or learning disabilities, are encouraged to speak with us so that appropriate accommodations can be arranged.
