"Our  form  of  government  makes  no  sense  unless  it  is  founded  in  a  deeply  felt  religious  faith.  And  I  don't   care  what  it  is."     
--  Attributed  to  Dwight  D.  Eisenhower,  1952      Course  Description   This  course  examines  the  intricate  relationship  between  church  and  state,  religion  and  politics,   throughout  American  history,  beginning  with  the  founders  and  how  they  have  been  interpreted  --   perhaps  misinterpreted  --  throughout  history.  We'll  look  at  the  contentious  election  of  1800,  examine   the  faith  of  several  presidents,  and  then  explore  the  rise  and  the  influence  of  the  Religious  Right  in   recent  years,  concluding  with  a  retrospective  on  religion  and  presidential  politics  over  the  past  half   century.      Textbooks   Balmer,  Randall.  God  in  the  White  House:  A  History:  How  Faith  Shaped  the  Presidency  from  John  F.
