In this class, you will have the opportunity to choose among various types of assignments. Each type offers a somewhat different way for you to demonstrate (to yourself, as well as to the instructor) your learning of course material.

Exams. Five 100-point exams will be available during the term, an hourly exam on each of the four sections of the course and a cumulative final exam. The 4th hourly exam and the
cumulative final will be given during the final exam session scheduled by the Registrar.
The format of the exams will be primarily objective (identification, multiple choice,
matching, fill-ins, etc.) with a mix of types of questions on each exam. These are closedbook, in-class exams. Total points available = 500

Practice tests. In the class before each section exam, a practice test will be available. The format will be multiple-choice questions with a scantron answer sheet. You will self-score your test and will receive 10 points simply for turning in the scantron, no matter how many questions you answer correctly. Total points available = 40

Do-overs. After each of the first three section exams, you will have an opportunity to improve your score by up to 15 points by reviewing and making any corrections you choose to a copy of your exam. Do-overs must be completed before the next scheduled class session. This is an open-book, open-note assignment. If you didn't take an exam, you are still eligible to take the do-over, for the maximum 15 points. Total points available = 45. (Note that fewer points may be available for exam scores above 85.)

Study group take-homes. You may choose to form a study group; study groups should include 4-5 members and must be "registered" with the instructor. Before each in-class exam (including the cumulative final), each registered study group will receive a set of review (short answer) questions to answer. Answers are submitted electronically; each takehome will receive up to 25 points. This is an open-book, open-note assignment. Total points available = 125.

Course grades will be based on the total number of points accumulated, based on the following scale:

625-710 = A 600-624 = A575-599 = B+ 550-574 = B 525-549 = B-

500-524 = C+ 475-499 = C 450-474 = C400-449 = D below 400 = E

.

Course policies: Because there are many ways to accumulate points in this course, make-ups will not be given. You do not need to provide a formal excuse or explanation.
The 4th and final exams will be given only during the time scheduled by the Registrar. Please do not make travel arrangements to leave campus earlier. Should unforeseen circumstances arise that prevent you from taking the exam at the scheduled time, you will need to have your dean contact me to initiate an Incomplete.
Class attendance is not required or recorded; however, material covered in class will form an important part of exam material.
Any student with a documented disability needing academic accommodations should speak to me and give me a copy of your form from Student Accessibility Services. I appreciate getting this information as soon as possible so that I can make appropriate arrangements. All discussions will remain confidential, although the accessibility coordinator may be consulted if questions arise.
The Honor Principle in this class. Your answers on the in-class, closed-book exams are to be your own individual work, not the work of others. Violations of the Honor Principle will, in addition to any discipline imposed by the College, result in failure in the course. The practice tests are not scored, but they will be the most useful to you if you do them by yourself, closedbook. The do-overs are open-book/note, but are to be your own individual work. For the study-group take-homes, you are encouraged to work together and use whatever resources you find helpful. All group members contributing to a particular take-home should acknowledge their participation on the submitted answers.
Additional resources: 1. A Canvas site is maintained for this class. 2. The publishers of your textbook maintain a web page with additional topic material, study
guide, and practice quizzes. 3. The Academic Skills Center offers general academic support and they may be able to identify
tutors for this course.
