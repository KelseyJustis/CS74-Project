Class Schedule:  MWF 8:459:50am (9L), Xhour:  Th 99:50am      Course goals 

  This course is designed to introduce students to basic statistical methods for the  design and analysis of psychology experiments. Subject areas include:  measurement, graphs, descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, mode, variance, 

standard deviation), elementary probability, simple correlation and regression,  distributions (e.g., normal, t, Chisquare, F), and inferential statistics (e.g.,  hypothesis testing, criterion, sources of error, power, effect size, and an  introduction to analysis of variance and factorial designs). 

  Learning Objectives   
By the end of this course, you should be able to:   Be able to analyze, both by hand and with the use of the computer  program, SPSS, data sets similar to those seen in psychological  experiments published in psychological journals   Be able to demonstrate proficiency in the computer program SPSS and use 

it in future courses   Be able to read journal articles and identify the type of statistical analysis 
used and how the authors interpreted their results   Be able to identify which statistical analysis is appropriate for a given 

experimental outcome.    Prerequisites   

You must have taken, or be taking concurrently, PSYCH 1:  Introductory  Psychology or PSYCH 6:  Introduction to Neuroscience in order to enroll in this  class.  Very few exceptions are made for nonPsychology majors, but for those 

2 
 
interested in taking statistics to fulfill another requirement, MATH 10 is a very  suitable choice.    Your Text     Your textbook is Chris Spatz's Basic Statistics (10th ed).  It is actually a pretty  nice book, and I have put a copy of the 9th edition on reserve in the library if you  get in a jam.  There is not much difference, but it is nice to have a good book for  the future.     I have also selected an additional optional text, Zealure (is that a great name or  what??!!) Holcomb's SPSS BASICS (3rd ed.). It is a wonderful manual for using  the program and you might want to hang on to it for reference in the future.  The  bookstore has some copies for you to purchase and I have already placed some  chapters on our Canvas site for you to examine.  Copies will be on reserve.   You may also like to use a scientific calculator and it should contain statistical  functions and memory.  While this is not to be considered an endorsement, I have  done well with a simple TI25 or TI30X (a good multiple function calculator can  be purchased for around $20).  More sophisticated calculators are also welcome,  but are useless unless you know how to get simple information out of them.  It is  your responsibility to learn how to use your calculator to compute simple  statistical functions.  Please bring a calculator to the quizzes.    And, no, your cell phone does not count as a calculator.  You are not allowed to use  your cell phone for any purpose during the inclass quizzes.    Tools for Data Analysis    Ask a statistician about her or his favorite program for doing statistics and you  will get a whole host of answers:  EXCEL for those on a budget, R for the young  whippersnappers, MathLab for those who like to keep a secret or STATA for those who  like tinkering with something a little different.  This term, the Psychology Department  has asked us to try to teach every student how to use Statistical Package for the Social  Sciences (SPSS).  This particular program is the industry standard for most of the social  sciences and should probably be on your list of things to know for the future.  You will  also need this program for Psychology 11.  Although SPSS is available on some  computers around campus (e.g., the second floor of Berry), I strongly encourage you to  get your own copy.    A six month subscription to SPSS is available through Eacademy at:  http://www.onthehub.com/spss/ .  Click on the "Buy Now" button for the IBM SPSS Statistics  Base GradPack 21.  The "Windows" pulldown menu on the next page is open.  If you have a  Mac, scroll down to the Mac pulldown menu toward the bottom of the page.  In both cases, go  to the "Download" section and click on the "Base GradPack 21" 6 month rental in blue type.  Read the operating system requirements.  If your computer meets the operating system 

3 
 
requirements, purchase the program for $36 (plus about $4.99 download fee).  You will need to  register for an account.  Then download according to instructions.    Statistical analyses for homework and take home portions of quizzes will require access to this  software.    Not having access to the public copies will not be accepted as an excuse for late  assignments or quizzess.     
    This is how you are going to be assessed during the course   
Your final grade for Psychology 10 will be:  A minimum of 20 homework exercises  (10% of your grade), 4 quizzes (70% of your grade), a final exam (15% of your grade) and an  SPSS practicum (5% of your grade).     Quizzes:  Quizzes involve two portions:  1. a takehome portion handed out in the class  prior to the inclass quiz and due on the morning of the quiz, and 2. an inclass portion.  These quizzes will cover both the class meetings and the readings and are cumulative.  In  order to promote learning through working with each other, you are allowed to  collaborate with others on the takehome portion of the quiz ONLY.  CAUTION:  There  is a difference between getting help from someone on a quiz and just copying their  answers. The former is a great place to learn, while the latter is a breach of the Honor  Principle.  It is your job to know the difference and if you do not know the difference,  ASK!    Policy for missed quizzes is very stringent.  For those few individuals who have  legitimate reasons (illness, etc.) for not being able to take a quiz at the scheduled time,  arrangements for the taking of the exam prior to its scheduled time must be made with me  as soon as you know that you cannot make the quiz.  If you miss a quiz without an  excuse, a grade of zero will result. 

4 
 
  Homework:  After each class, a small set of homework problems will be posted on our  Canvas site and you are to complete this assignment by midnight (usually) on the day of  the next class.1  Homework assignments are short and to the point, so don't let them slip  by without giving them a try.  Homeworks are only counted and not graded, but we do  spot check each homework to make sure that people are not just handing in junk.  If you  are handing in blank pages or junk, we reserve the right to drop that homework from your  total number of homeworks.  There are a total of 21 possible homeworks and each  homework is worth 1/2 of a point, so you can choose not to do a homework and STILL  get full credit for this portion of the course.  The maximum you can earn for completing  each assignment is 10 points, but if you complete ALL 21 homeworks, I will add THREE  points to your final exam (prior to the calculation of the actual percentage).      SPSS Practicum:     This course will require you to demonstrate proficiency in the  statistical program SPSS.  In order to do so, you will be asked to complete the exercises  at the end of each chapter in Holcomb's SPSS BASIC to the appropriate Canvas page.  THIS PART OF THE COURSE IS ENTIRELY SELFPACED.  We will post the  answers for you to view at any time, but will ask that you demonstrate your proficiency  by taking a practicum.  This practicum will be a short set of data for you to analyze using  SPSS and you can do one of two things to demonstrate your proficiency:  OPTION ONE:  You can take two small practicums, one after OCTOBER 11 and the other after  NOVEMBER 15.  If you do not pass the first version, you can take a larger version later  in the term to redeem yourself.  OPTION TWO:  You can take one large practicum after  NOVEMBER 15.  Keep in mind that this portion of the course is yours to do at your own  speed.  All that you need to do to demonstrate proficiency (and obtain an easy 5% of your  grade) is to work on SPSS from time to time and just pass the practicum.  We will be  doing this in conjunction with your homeworks, but this provides a blowbyblow  account of how to do statistical analyses with SPSS.    Alternative Abilities.   
I truly encourage those students with disabilities (as defined by the Academic  Skill Center), including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and learning  disabilities, to discuss with me after class or during my office hours appropriate  accommodations that might be useful to them.  Any student with a documented disability  needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak to me by the end  of the second week of the term.  All discussions will remain confidential, although the  Student Disabilities Coordinator may be consulted to verify the documentation of the  disability.   
  Honor Principle   
1 We will operate by the midnight to midnight rule.  That is, if I do not post the homework by midnight on the day of  class, I will count that homework as done by everyone that day.  Fair is fair, I suppose... 

5 
 

All activities and performances in this course are governed by the Honor Principle.  I 

invite students to work with one another on homeworks, but there is a fine line between 

working together and copying someone else's work.  If you are caught copying a homework 

from another student or looking at an answer key before your homework is completed, you will 

be reported for violating the Honor Principle.   

 

While working on homework and your prequiz takehome together is allowed, no 

collaboration is permitted on any portion of the inclass quiz.  I repeat:  IT IS A VIOLATION 

OF THE HONOR PRINCIPLE TO COLLABORATE ON OR TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE ON 

THE INCLASS PORTIONS OF QUIZZES OR ON THE SPSS PRACTICUM.  THIS 

INCLUDES ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF OBTAINING EXAMPLES OF EXAMS 

FROM STUDENTS WHO TOOK THIS COURSE IN THE PAST.

2 OK, I have to be honest...this is a tentative schedule.  I occasionally get carried away with one or two particular topics 
and have too much of a good thing.  Stay flexible, give good feedback about how you are handling the workload, and 
we'll both have a good time.  3 Each week, we offer the opportunity for you to submit a question for us to review in an xhour.  If no one submits a 
question, we do not have much to do.  We occasionally do a question from an exam, just to let everyone see what they 
might have struggled with so they can move on to newer material.
