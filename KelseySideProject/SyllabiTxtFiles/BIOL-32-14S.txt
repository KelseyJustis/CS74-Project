Course Description
This is an intermediate level course that will examine how and why animals have evolved to communicate with one another. The study of animal behavior, and communication in particular, is interdisciplinary because it integrates information about the physics of the signals to which animals respond, the neural basis of signal detection and processing, and the evolutionary mechanisms that can influence communication in animals.
Course Objectives
The objectives of this course are to... 1. Examine how animals communicate with each other: proximate questions about communication.
The physical adaptations and constraints on generating and receiving signals in different sensory modalities (acoustic, visual, olfactory, and others) 2. Investigate the evolutionary processes that influence communication in animals. Issues related to decision-making, information, honesty, receiver psychology, sensory exploitation, and multimodal signals 3. Examine why animals communicate with each other: ultimate questions about communication. A look at the most common contexts for communication in animals (conflict, mating, social and interspecific interactions) 4. Integrate this information and these concepts in a look at human communication
Text Book and Resources
Text book: Bradbury, JW and Vehrencamp, SL (2012) Principles of Animal Communication, 2nd ed. Sinauer Associates; Sunderland, Massachusetts.
The text book is not required, but it can be helpful as a supplementary source of information and alternative format for understanding the material covered in the lectures. Companion website for the text book: http://sites.sinauer.com/animalcommunication2e/index.html
Here you can find the "web topics" and a list of the references cited in the textbook. A copy of the text book is on reserve at the library (http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/reserves/). Articles that are required reading will be posted on canvas.

Course Structure and Expectations

Course material will be delivered in lectures or by student-led presentations with discussions. Part I (Signal Modalities) and Part III (Signal Context) will cover background information necessary for understanding later concepts; therefore, these parts of the course will consist of lectures. I encourage you to ask questions or make comments at any time during these lectures and I hope these will often lead to class discussion. Part II (Signal Evolution) covers and integrates ideas that are best learned through discussion, and in this section of the course, students will be asked to prepare presentations that summarize review or opinion articles from the primary literature and to lead discussions of these papers (see "Evaluation" below for details). Part IV (Human Communication) will be a mix of lectures and discussions.

Students are expected to abide by the Dartmouth College Academic Honor Principle: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/acad-honor.html I encourage you to discuss course material with classmates in preparation for the presentations and exams. Keep in mind, however, that students must not give or receive help during exams and that the presentation and discussion questions must be the results of the student's own independent work, not the result of a collaborative effort with others.

Student Needs

Academic Skills Center: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills Research Center for Writing, and Information Technology: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rwit

Student Accessibility Services: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see me before the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Accessibility Services office may be consulted to discuss appropriate implementation of any accommodation requested.

Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations

Evaluation

Evaluation will be based on three cumulative exams plus class presentations and discussions. Exams I & II will be held during class time (see course schedule below).

Exams: Midterm I (20%), Midterm II (25%), Final (35%). Each exam will consist of short and long answer questions. Although the exams will focus on the material covered since the previous exam, much of the information from earlier components in the course will be incorporated into the increasingly integrative material later in the course. In this sense, the exams will be cumulative. Presentations: (10%). Each student will be assigned one article from the primary literature to summarize for the class in a short (10 min) presentation. This will be the introduction for the following student-led discussion of the paper. Detailed instructions for this assignment will be posted on canvas. Discussions: leading (5%), participating (5%). For each article presented in class, another student will lead the discussion of the paper with the class. Therefore, each student will be discussion leader for one article, but not the same article as they present. Discussion leaders should prepare a list of thoughts and questions for the class that they can draw on to facilitate the discussion of the most interesting / controversial / confusing aspects of the article. Detailed instructions for this assignment will be posted on canvas.
