Government 30
Policy, Politics and the Knowledge Economy
Prof. Bernard Avishai, bavishai@gmail.com, 603 748 9040
Dartmouth College, Department of Government, Spring Quarter, 2013
Introduction
This course explores the shifting relationship between the private sector and government policy in the networked world. As advanced technologies reshape corporate architectures, and transform the terms of competition for both globals and start-ups, the actions of government must change correspondingly. Have they?
Arguably, the social compact of a democratic society has nor changed: businesses create value through competition and governments set the rules to engender social fairness, personal liberty and mobility based on merit. But much of what governments expect to do was learned from a previous time: an industrial-manufacturing system in enclosed national economies. Today, multiple information revolutions have changed things. Public policy has not always caught up.
So we shall analyze the impact of technological changes as well as the knowledge economy in microcosm--especially evolving network effects. We shall ask the urgent questions: What public services, infrastructure and standards are necessary to democracy and, correspondingly or not, facilitate growth? What are the implications of peer networks for the delivery of services--from healthcare to education--that citizens have come to expect in a democracy?
What, moreover, are the limits of established notions of intellectual property--patents, for example? What new metrics might be used to account for corporate performance and valuable assets? Do macroeconomic indicators tell us what we need to know--does the distinction between services and manufacturing still hold? Is there really a trade-off between growth and green? We shall, in short, push into new modes of thinking, unburdened by outdated ideological lines.
Course Requirements
The class will run as a series of discussions based on assigned reading. Attendance is compulsory.
Examinations are meant to stimulate team-based learning. Students will form study groups and divide up the labor involved in preparing thoughtful answers to prearranged questions. However, students will be judged individually. The mid-term-will be worth 30%, the paper 30%, and the final 40%. The grade may be reduced by as much as 10% for uncertain class participation or unexcused absences.
