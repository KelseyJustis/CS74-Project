Course Description
This course is an introduction to comparative political economy, the comparative politics of domestic economic policies. Topics include: market reforms in developed, developing, and postsocialist countries, varieties of welfare capitalism, (de)regulation and privatization, federalism, the effects of political institutions on economic development, interest groups, property rights, the political business cycle, and corruption. We will look in depth at both developed and developing countries, with an emphasis on understanding why they choose (or end up with) the policies and institutions that they have, even when in some cases these policies and institutions might hamper development or increase poverty. The central goal of this course is to develop your ability to reason through political explanations of economic policies.
It is recommended but not required that you have taken Introduction to Comparative Politics and at least one economics course prior to taking this class.
Course Requirements and Grading
Class will combine lectures and discussion sessions, and attendance is required. You must do all the reading for a particular class meeting before that class. Class participation (quality and quantity) comprises 25% of your course grade. There is a 1600-word essay on an assigned topic due October 21, which will count as 20% of your grade. In the final two class periods we will hold in-class team debates on different topics. Your preparation for your debate comprises 15% of your grade. There will be a take-home essay final exam, which counts for 40% of your course grade. This exam must meet all the requirements of a standard academic paper, includng citations of sources.
