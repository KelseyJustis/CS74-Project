GOVT 50.03 Human Rights and International Relations

Fall 2012, Time period 2 Mon, Wed & Fri: 1:45-2:50 X-Hour: Thu 1:00-1:50 Classroom: Silsby 213

Brian Greenhill brian.d.greenhill@dartmouth.edu Office hours (Silsby 223): Tue & Fri 3:00-4:00pm & by appt.

Course Description: States' human rights practices are no longer viewed as simply a domestic political issue. Since the end of WWII, a complex system of international laws and institutions has developed that aims to regulate the human rights practices of states. In this course we will study the politics of the human rights regime and consider the following big questions:  What exactly are human rights?  Does international human rights law have any impact on states' behavior? If so, how?  Is globalization good or bad for human rights?  How effective are non-governmental organizations in changing states' human rights
practices?  Is the evolving human rights regime changing what it means to be a state in the 21st
century?
Pre-requisites: This course is designed for students who have already taken GOVT 5 (Introduction to International Relations) or equivalent. It will assume a basic understanding of the major theoretical approaches to IR (i.e., realism, liberalism and constructivism).
Assignments: One of the most important set of skills you will develop in college is the ability to express complex ideas clearly in writing and in speech. This is essential for just about any career you might be considering. The assignments in this course are designed to help you to develop these skills. Your overall grade for this course will be made up of the following elements:
25%: Short Paper 1 25%: Short Paper 2 30%: Final Exam (take-home) 20%: Participation (in-class & online)
The goal of each short paper assignment is to provide a 4-5 page report (called a "literature review") summarizing the latest research on a particular issue that is of interest to you. The topic must be connected to the politics of human rights. I

recommend approaching it by posing one specific question that your literature review will seek to answer. An example would be, "Is trade good or bad for human rights in developing countries?" Once you've clearly defined your question, go on to provide a critical review of the more significant pieces of research that speak to that issue. Wherever possible, identify ways in which these studies complement or contradict each other. Conclude with a paragraph that reflects on how well recent research has been able to answer the question you first posed. If possible, try to add a sentence or two that suggests what the most promising directions for future research might be. Please note that we'll be spending a whole class discussing this type of assignment on Wednesday September 19.
The final exam is in the form of an open book take-home exam. It will take the form of either one or two short essay questions designed to test your understanding of the material covered in the course.
The remaining 20% of your grade is based upon your overall level of participation, both in class and online. To score a high grade for participation, you are expected to actively participate in class discussions and to frequently contribute thoughtful questions, comments and responses to the online discussion board. There is no minimum number of comments in class or posts to the discussion board required for a high grade, but good participation will involve making comments and raising questions that you think will help your fellow students to better understand the material covered in the course. Students who are less comfortable speaking up in class can still achieve a high grade for participation by making additional posts on the online discussion board.
Important Dates and Deadlines:  Friday October 12: First short paper due by 6:00pm.  Sunday November 11: Second short paper due by 6:00pm.  Monday November 19: Final papers due by 6:00pm.
All completed assignments are to be uploaded to Blackboard in pdf format.
Academic Integrity: All students are responsible for understanding and adhering to Dartmouth's rules on academic integrity. The following website provides an excellent discussion of some of the questions commonly raised in discussions about plagiarism: http:// www.dartmouth.edu/%7Ewriting/sources/sources-citation.html
