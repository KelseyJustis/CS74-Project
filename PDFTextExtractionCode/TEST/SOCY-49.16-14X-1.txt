Socy 49.16 -- Community: Analysis & Action

Course Description: This course will examine the idea of a safe, inclusive community and how it might be realized on a college campus. We will examine the tremendous changes that a society experiences as it moves from a social order based mainly on face-to-face interactions and obligations to one based on anonymous market forces, bureaucratic state power and virtual relationships. And we will look at how communities have endured despite these changes. We will look at the advantages and disadvantages of communities today, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of our longing for community. We will look at the practices that undermine community and the practices that support community. Finally, we will engage in action-oriented research projects concerned with community at Dartmouth.

The goal of this class is to help students to examine their own community in a meaningful and thoughtful way and to understand that a college community is a difficult and complex accomplishment. The idea behind this class is that effective change comes from students who have been given the tools to understand their own situation.

Grades: Your grade will be determined according to the following formula:

Reading Points Reading Point Tests Community & Society @ Dartmouth Paper Inhibiting Community Paper Policy Project

10% 30% (2 x 15%) 15% 20% 25%

Incompletes will only be given when the student is otherwise passing the course and cannot complete it due to circumstances that are unforeseen and beyond the student's control.

Reading Points: For each reading, I will provide a set of questions that you should be prepared to answer when called on in class. Only students called on in class will be graded on that day. If you are absent the day that I call on you without a university defined excuse, you will receive an 'F'. Since each student is likely to be called on only 5 or 6 times, it is important that you be prepared for every class. I will give everyone one 'free pass' for the term on reading points. In other words, you can let me know that you will be unprepared to answer the points for that day. However, you must do this before class starts, either by email, in person, or phone. You will not be given a free pass after I have called on you.
Reading Point Tests: There will be two short, written tests over the reading points. The final test will not be cumulative. The first test will be on Fri. 7/18. The second at the time of our final 8/24 at 8:00 am
Written Assignments: There will be three written assignments for this class. Community & Society @ Dartmouth: 6-8 page paper using class readings to analyze how the mix of
community and society stand at Dartmouth today. This paper will involve semi-structured interviews with members of the Dartmouth community In this paper, we simply try to inform ourselves about the multiple perspectives that make up Dartmouth and the multiple visions of community.

Inhibiting Community: 6-8 page paper using class readings and library research to analyze a social structure or practice that undermines community. We empower ourselves when we understand how some structures or practices can take power away from some members of the community. This will be due by 8/11
Policy Project: 8-10 page paper using class readings, library research and ethnographic investigation to analyze practices and make policy recommendations for promoting community at Dartmouth. For this paper, students will research and write about something that they will take responsibility for. The student should understand themselves as having an active role in building the Dartmouth community, but at the same time they should be aware of the larger political, economic and social contexts that may also be a source of power or disempowerment.
Complete descriptions and the criteria for grading will be posted on Blackboard.
