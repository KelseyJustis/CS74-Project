Course Objectives:
This course aims primarily at introducing you to the writings of Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), the Danish philosopher-theologian who has been called "the founder of existentialism." Most of this course will involve an exploration of Kierkegaard's major writings. Towards the end of the

course, in class sessions and through student papers and presentations, we will examine Kierkegaard's impact on religious and non-religious thinkers who are identified as existentialists.
Course Requirements:
1. A brief (no more than 2-page; 12-point, double spaced Palatino type; ~ 650 words maximum) essay responding to a question about specific passages or statements in the Kierkegaard text under discussion for each class meeting. One or more questions (you should choose only one) are available in the folder "DISC QUES & DROP BOX" on Blackboard). Your brief essay is to be submitted electronically in that same folder no later than 5 p.m. the day before the relevant class meeting. There are 16 possible essay assignments. Each student must submit 8 (5 points apiece; 40% of the total course grade).The essays will be evaluated for their comprehension of the assigned text and their insight.
2. Informed participation in class discussion. This participation, based on the questions distributed in advance, will form the participation grade (20% of course grade). This will include one or more brief class presentations of one's discussion paper or an assigned response to another student's discussion paper. Papers for response will be posted on Blackboard by 9 p.m. on the evening before class in the folder "PAPERS FOR RESPONSE," and one or more respondents for each paper will be named there. The content of the discussion paper and the response should be delivered briefly by the writer and respondent in class. The response should briefly summarize the essay's argument and offer critical (positive and/or negative) comments. Note: if you do not write an essay or a response for a specific class or topic, you are still held responsible for reading the assignment and being prepared to discuss it.
3. A research paper (12 pages maximum, not including bibliography 12-point, double spaced Palatino type) and possible class presentation on a topic proposed by you or suggested by the instructor (40% of the course grade). Selected papers will form the basis of class discussion and presentations at the end of the course. Suggested topics (with bibliography) are available in the Blackboard folder "Course Materials: "Research Paper Topics"), or students can propose their own topic of interest. A one-page paper proposal (with sample bibliography) is due at the start of class on May 1. The paper itself is due in the "RES PAP DROP BOX" folder (on Blackboard) as a PDF not a Word document by 5 p.m. on Sunday, May 25.
Note: Circumstances may require changes in this syllabus and revision of requirements and assignments.
