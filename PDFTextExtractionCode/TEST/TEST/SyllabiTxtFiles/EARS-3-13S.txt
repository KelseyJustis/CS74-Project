Course description & learning objectives:
The ocean covers approximately 70 percent of the Earth's surface, yet we still know very little about the marine environment...it is our final (Earthbound) frontier. Oceanography is the study of the marine environment and represents one of the original 'environmental sciences' in that it draws upon the collaborative expertise of chemists, biologists, physicists and geologists alike. In this course, we will introduce this multidisciplinary approach.
We will learn about interactions between the physical, biological, and geological processes in the sea, and understand the complexity of the sea as a natural system. We will learn about the sea's resources, its contribution to global climate, its significance as a recording of Earth's environmental history, and its importance as the likely setting for life's beginnings.
During this course, you will learn the following specific key concepts and skills at an introductory level:
· Geologic time and geologic scale; · Earth's origins; · Use of maps (or, in marine settings, charts) and spatial data; · The process of science and the evolution of scientific concepts; · The Earth (especially the ocean!) as a dynamic system of physical, chemical and biological
interactions; · The importance of natural resources and the physical environment on the evolution of life
(and vice versa); · The role of uncertainty in our understanding of Earth processes, resources and hazards. Prerequisites:
There are no prerequisites.

Course Requirements and Grading: Class participation (10% of grade): This will be calculated solely based on the number of in-class exercises you complete. Each student receives 3 "free passes" to miss class for any reason they deem necessary ­ illness, sports or performance conflict, family commitment, job interviews, etc. There is no need to contact me about absences unless there are special circumstances (extended absences). Quizzes (10% of grade): There will be 2 quizzes during the term on the reading and lectures. This is to help you prepare for the exams by testing your knowledge and giving you incentive to keep up with the reading. Homework Assignments (30% of grade): There will be five homework assignments throughout the term. You will have at least 1 week to complete each assignment. Midterm Exam (25% of grade): 50 min during X-Hour on Tuesday, April 16 from 1212:50 pm, covers material from the beginning of the course up to the exam. Final Exam (25% of grade): 1 hr exam at on Monday May 13.
Course Grading Scale: Letter grades will be assigned to your cumulative total points according to the following: A  95.00 > A-  90.00 > B+  85.00 > B  80.00 > B-  75.00 > C+  70.00 > C  65.00 etc.
I must adhere to these cutoffs to be fair to all students. If you have a cumulative average grade of 89.99% at the end of the term, then you will get a B+.
Grading Questions and Corrections: Despite our best efforts, grading errors are likely with 150 students in the class. Please review all of your homework, quiz, and exam grades for errors and inconsistencies, and ask the TAs or me any questions within 1 week after each is returned.
Unexpectedly Missing Quizzes and Exams: If you have to miss a quiz or exam, YOU MUST CONTACT ME BEFORE THE QUIZ OR EXAM STARTS to explain your absence and make plans for taking the exam/quiz at the next available time. Email (erich.c.osterberg@dartmouth.edu) and telephone (603-646-1096) are ways to contact me. If I do not answer the phone, leave a message! You may be expected to provide a letter from your doctor, dean, family member (etc.) explaining that your absence was justified.
***FAILURE TO CONTACT ME BEFORE THE EXAM/QUIZ OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE A VALID REASON FOR YOUR ABSENCE MAY RESULT IN YOU RECEIVING A 0% ON THE EXAM OR QUIZ***
NO make-up exams/quizzes will be available without a valid reason for absence.
Planned Absences during Quizzes or Exams: If you know ahead of time that you will be absent from a quiz or exam (e.g. for a college-affiliated extra-curricular activity, job interview, etc.), speak with me about it as soon as you know so that accommodations can be made. In general, my policy is to allow students to take exams and quizzes early for a planned absence, but not to take it late unless there are special circumstances.

Late Homework Assignments: Homework assignments are due at 5 pm on the due date. You should turn in your assignments in the EARS 3 drop box on the second floor of Fairchild Hall.
5% will be deducted for each day that an assignment is late, unless you discuss the situation with me prior to the original due date. For example, an assignment due on Wednesday would
be deducted 5% if turned in between 5 pm Wednesday and 5 pm Thursday, and 10% if turned in between 5 pm Thursday and 5 pm Friday, etc. If you are unable to complete an assignment
on time due to illness or other personal reasons, you may be eligible to have this penalty waived. You are encouraged to talk to me as soon as possible, and if necessary, meet with
your Dean to discuss your situation.

Disability-Related Accommodations: Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services are encouraged to see me
privately as early as possible in the term. Students requiring disability-related academic adjustments and services MUST consult the Student Accessibility Services office (301 Collis
Student Center, 646-9900, student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu). Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent
Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, they should contact the
SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.

Religious Observances: If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in this course, please meet with me as early as possible to discuss accommodations.

Academic Honor Principle: You should be aware of and conform to the Dartmouth Honor Code as expressed in the ORC. Any suspected Honor Principle Violations will be reported to the Dartmouth Committee on Standards (COS). For this course, be aware of the following:
· Quizzes and Exams: All work on quizzes and exams is your own. · Homeworks: You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments in groups, but what
you turn in must be written in your own words.
· In-class assignments: Writing someone's name on an in-class assignment sheet who is not actually in class that day IS an Honor Principle Violation and will be reported.
· Plagiarism: Be sure to cite all references in homework assignments. · If you are unsure, please ask how the Honor Principle applies to this course.
