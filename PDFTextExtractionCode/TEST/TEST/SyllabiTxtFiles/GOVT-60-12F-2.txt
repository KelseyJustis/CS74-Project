Indigenous Nationalism: Native Rights and Sovereignty 
  Professor: Dale Turner   Classroom:  101 Fairchild  Office:  202 Sherman House  Phone:  6460324  Office Hours: T 12:0012:30, Th12:0012:30 (preferably by appointment)     Course Description:    
The recently ratified United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)  has changed the face of international Indigenous politics. In this course, we will examine and  compare contemporary Indigenous politics in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia (with the  occasional glance to the United States). In these four "settler" states, Indigenous peoples de  facto possess some "special" form of political recognition. In Canada, the rights of Aboriginal  peoples are explicitly protected in the Canadian Constitution; in New Zealand, the political  relationship between the Maori and European newcomers (Pakeha) is governed by the renewed  principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi; and, the Australian state now recognizes the legal  existence of Native title in Australian law.    The course is divided into four parts. In order to gain a basic understanding of the discourse of  Indigenous rights we begin by examining, in some depth, contemporary Aboriginal politics in  Canada. Using Canada as a benchmark, in the second and third parts of the course we will  explore recent developments in New Zealand and Australian Indigenous politics. Finally, we will  examine the UN's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and discuss Indigenous  peoples' "place" within a constitutional democracy.     The purpose of the seminar is to develop a greater understanding of the discourse of Indigenous  rights, the nature of a crosscultural political dialogue, the significance of historical agreements  and reparations, and, of course, the meaning of justice itself. We will see that settler states  share similar attitudes about the nature of Indigenous cultures, the moral and political  significance of historical agreements, and especially the meaning and content of Indigenous  rights, sovereignty, and nationhood.
