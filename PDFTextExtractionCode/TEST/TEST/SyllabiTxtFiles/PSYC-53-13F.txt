COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course will provide an overview of the rapidly growing field of social neuroscience. We will consider primarily how social processes are implemented at the neural level, but also how neural mechanisms help give rise to social phenomena and constrain culture. Many believe that the large expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with social others-- competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them. What kind of "social brain" has this evolutionary past left us with? In this course, we will review current theories and methods guiding social neuroscience and recent research examining the brain basis of social processes, including theory of mind; empathy; emotion; reading faces, bodies, and voices; morality; among others. Overall, this course will introduce students to the emerging field of social neuroscience and its multi-level approach to understanding the brain in its social context.
TEXTBOOK
Ward, D. The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press.
ASSIGNMENTS
Research Thought Papers 2 pages, 1" margins, double-spaced, 11 or 12 pt. font. Two research thought papers will be due this term. In each, you will select an original research article of your choice. These will involve you expanding on a topic you found particularly interesting from the course material. These will be evaluated on how well they connect the article to ideas from class in a novel, interesting, and meaningful way. This, of course, will be influenced by clarity and concision in writing as well.
Discussion Teams The class will be divided into a number of discussion teams. Each team will lead an hour discussion on the assigned readings. These discussions should unpack the assigned readings and relate them to relevant material from the class (previous readings, textbook chapters, class discussion and material I've presented) in a novel, interesting, and meaningful fashion. Discussion teams have a great deal of latitude

in form of presentation (e.g., standard PowerPoint presentations, breaking into small groups, debate, inclass experiment)--whatever the team feels would best convey the critical ideas most effectively and interestingly. Discussions will be evaluated on content, effectiveness, and clarity. Creative tactics to discussion are not required but they could certainly help by increasing effectiveness and clarity. Each team should schedule a meeting with me in advance to go over the discussion plan. Each student should plan on having a relatively equal role in the discussion. Students will be evaluated separately; that said, if the team is dysfunctional then everyone's discussion leading will likely suffer.
Exams There will be a midterm and a final, which will include multiple choice and short answer/essay questions.

POLICIES
Attendance You should plan on attending all class sessions. Please let me know in advance if you will be missing a class. I will often be discussing material not covered in the textbook or assigned readings, and so you would be missing this material (which could be covered on the exams). Of course, I hope you will be interested to come to class for the sheer excitement of it all (!), regardless of practical exam concerns.
Disabilities Those with disabilities who may need accommodations should make an appointment with me early in the term. Once SAS has authorized accommodations, the College expects students to show the originally signed SAS Accommodations/Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to their professor. As a first step, if you have questions about whether you qualify to receive accommodations, you should contact the SAS office.
Late Work Without an official documented College excuse (health or family emergency), assignments may be accepted after their deadline, but they will be penalized one letter grade per day late.
Academic Dishonesty The College has specific guidelines regarding cheating, plagiarism, and academic dishonesty. If caught, students will fail the course, will be reported to the College, and the College will impose a set of penalties. This course adheres to the guidelines of Academic Honor published in the Dartmouth College Bulletin: Organization, Regulations and Courses, 2011-2012. Also see: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~deancoll.
