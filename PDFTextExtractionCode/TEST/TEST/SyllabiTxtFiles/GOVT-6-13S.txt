Government 6: Political Ideas
Spring term, 2013 MWF 11 Professor Russell Muirhead Silsby 218 Office hours: Wed 1-3

Politics is about power. It is difficult--perhaps impossible--to get power and to keep it without advancing an idea about why one should have it. There is no power without ideas about what makes power right: politics, therefore, is about ideas. Who should rule? Toward what ends? What is justice? Or perhaps we should ask, whose justice? Maybe more important even than justice is injustice: what counts as intolerable injustice? Every politics contains answers (and often rival
answers) to these questions.

Whether we know it or not, our own answers owe a great debt to the history of political thought in the West--to thinkers we will encounter this term like Plato and Aristotle, Hobbes and Locke, Rousseau and Marx. On the traditional or ancient conception, politics would ideally be about excellence: the excellent would rule. On the modern conception, the point of politics is not to foster or recognize excellence, but to secure the goods we can all agree are good: security and prosperity. Should we regard modern politics as an advance over older understandings and practices? Or should ancient political ideas linger, and inform even contemporary understandings of justice?
