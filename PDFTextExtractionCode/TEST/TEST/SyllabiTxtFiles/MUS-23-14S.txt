The Book Samuel Adler "The Study of Orchestration" (recommended)
The course An exploration of instrumentation and principles of musical form in Western music. Through weekly analysis and scoring exercises, students learn to read scores, understand musical structure, and write for combinations of instruments with attention to timbre, range, performance techniques, and orchestral idioms. Assignments include arrangements, for small and large ensemble, and formal analyses of several musical works whose aim is to show how composers shape melody, harmony and timbre to create large-scale musical structures.
Assignments
Two small and a medium projects and a large final project will be completed in this term. No late projects will be accepted. The score must be prepared and printed neatly, either by hand or by computer score generating software.
