      COURSE  DESCRIPTION   How  do  we  learn,  understand,  and  teach  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  math  (the   STEM  disciplines)?  In  this  class,  we  will  explore  the  nature  and  development  of  the   scientific  mind;  how  we  formulate  theories,  design  experiments,  and  understand   scientific,  technological,  and  mathematical  concepts;  and  how  we  learn  and  teach  related   skills  in  the  classroom,  addressing  the  debate  about  the  effectiveness  of  direct  instruction   and  hands-on  approaches.         COURSE  GOALS   This  course  challenges  students  to  think  critically  about  the  relationship  between  what   we  know  about  the  mind  from  experimental  research  and  how  we  teach  students  to  learn   in  actual  classroom  settings.    In-class  discussion  of  assigned  readings  is  a  critical   component  of  this  course.    We  will  discuss  such  topics  as  how  people  learn  mathematical   and  scientific  reasoning,  how  knowledge  is  stored  and  organized  in  the  mind,  and  how   schools  have  used  and  could  use  the  findings  of  psychological  research  to  improve   student  learning.    Developing  the  skills  of  critically  reading  empirical  research  articles,   writing  a  research  paper  for  a  scientific  audience,  and  using  knowledge  of  the  scientific   literature  to  argue  for  a  specific  position  are  central  to  achieving  these  course  goals.         GRADING  OVERVIEW   15%     Class  Participation   10%     Short  Opinion  Paper   25%   Pop  Quizzes  (5)   25%   Debate  Presentation  and  Position  Paper   25%   Final  Examination

GENERAL  POLICIES   1. Read  all  materials  and  prepare  for  class.    You  are  expected  to  read  the   materials  posted  on  Blackboard  before  each  class.    Be  prepared  to  discuss  that   material  in  class.  Everyone  is  expected  to  come  to  every  class  and  to  arrive  on  time.     You  are  also  expected  to  contribute  to  class  discussion.    You  will  learn  the  material   better  and  others  will  learn  from  you.    The  success  of  this  course  depends  on   everyone  coming  to  class  prepared  and  ready  to  discuss  the  material.  Both   attendance  (on-time)  and  preparation  for  class  will  determine  a  portion  of  your   grade  (see  "Assignments  and  Assessments"  below).       2. Tell  me  sooner  rather  than  later.    If  you  know  ahead  of  time  that  you  will  be   missing  a  class,  e.g.,  for  sports  or  religious  observance,  please  let  me  know  in   advance  in  order  to  avoid  losing  course  credit.     3. ASSUME  THAT  I  WILL  NOT  ACCEPT  LATE  ASSIGNMENTS.   4. Cell  phones  are  not  to  be  used  in  class.  If  an  emergency  arises  that  requires  the   use  of  a  phone,  please  quietly  excuse  yourself  from  the  room  to  respond.       5. Accommodations.  Students  with  learning,  physical,  or  psychiatric  disabilities   enrolled  in  this  course  who  may  need  disability-related  classroom   accommodations  are  encouraged  to  make  an  office  appointment  to  see  me  early  in   the  semester  (i.e.,  within  the  first  two  weeks).  If  you  have  not  done  so  already,   students  requiring  disability-related  accommodations  should  register  with  the   Student  Accessibility  Services  office  regarding  Dartmouth's  policies  and  available   resources:  http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/   6. Plagiarism  is  unacceptable.    All  work  submitted  as  your  own  must  be  written  by   you  and  not  previously  submitted  for  any  other  class.  It  is  important  to  attribute   material  that  is  the  work  of  others  to  the  original  source.  If  you  are  unsure  how  to   properly  cite  a  source,  please  consult  with  me  prior  to  handing  in  an  assignment.     You  should  be  familiar  with  Dartmouth's  Academic  Honor  Principle,  which  applies   to  all  courses  at  Dartmouth  (available  here:  www.dartmouth.edu/~uja/honor/  ).  I   do  not  expect  any  violations  of  this  code,  but  if  any  concerns  do  arise  I  will  forward   all  related  materials  to  Dartmouth's  Committee  on  Standards.   7. Before  you  turn  in  your  papers...  make  sure  that  you  use  12-point Times New Roman font,  that  you  double-space  the  whole  document,  that  your  print  margins   are  1-inch  on  all  sides  (not  the  default  in  Word),  that  all  your  pages  are  numbered,   and  that  your  document  is  stapled  together  (if  printed).    For  citations  in  all  papers,   you  must  use  APA  Style  formatting  (refer  to  the  APA  Style  Manual  or  online   guides,  such  as:    http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/  )

ASSIGNMENTS  and  ASSESSMENTS   Class  Participation  &  Attendance  (15%)  
- Arrive  on  time  for  each  class   - Prepare  for  class  discussions  (read  the  assigned  materials,  stay  awake  during  class,  
stay  off  internet,  etc.)   - Demonstrate  that  you  are  familiar  with  the  assigned  readings.    Complete  
understanding  of  the  readings  prior  to  class  discussion  is  not  expected  ­  questions   about  the  readings  are  always  encouraged.  Hopefully  discussion  will  help  elucidate   any  confusing  aspects  of  the  articles.  In  this  way,  your  comments  and  questions   will  help  everyone  understand  the  material  in  greater  depth.  
  
Debate  Presentation  and  Position  Paper  (25%)   - On  two  separate  occasions,  two  groups  will  debate  a  given  motion  (see  schedule   for  the  motions)  ­  one  group  will  argue  for  the  motion  and  one  against.   - Each  team  will  research  the  given  topic  and,  as  a  group,  decide  on  the  best   evidentiary  and  logical  support  for  their  assigned  position.   - The  groups  will  divide  the  relevant  aspects  of  their  argument  amongst  their   members  such  that  each  team  member  (except  one)  will  make  an  opening   statement  reflecting  a  different  aspect  of  their  team's  overall  argument.   - Following  the  opening  statements,  class  members  who  are  not  debating  (i.e.,  the   audience),  will  each  ask  a  question  directed  at  one  or  both  teams.       - Finally,  the  team  member  on  each  team  who  did  not  make  an  opening  statement   will  make  a  closing  statement  summarizing  his  or  her  team's  position  and   incorporating  points  that  were  raised  during  the  debate.   - At  the  start  of  the  debate,  I  will  poll  the  audience  to  determine  what  percentage   agrees  with  the  motion  prior  to  the  debate.  I  will  poll  again  afterwards  to  see  if   anyone  was  persuaded  by  the  debate  to  change  his  or  her  mind.  The  team  who   persuades  the  most  audience  members  to  choose  their  side  wins  the  debate.   - Prior  to  the  debate,  each  team  will  post  1  reading  to  Blackboard  that  they  deem  the   most  pertinent  for  the  audience  to  read  in  advance.    Each  debate  will  take  place  on   a  Thursday  and  these  readings  are  to  be  posted  on  Blackboard  no  later  than  the   preceding  Tuesday.       - Each  team  will  meet  with  me  during  the  X-hour  on  the  day  prior  to  the  debate  to   outline  their  arguments  and  get  my  feedback.  At  this  time,  a  draft  position  paper  is   due  from  each  team  member  that  summarizes  your  team's  position,  emphasizing   your  unique  contribution  to  the  team's  literature  research.  The  draft  can  be  in   mostly  outline  format,  but  must  contain  at  least  4  relevant  scientific  references.  At   least  one  of  these  must  not  be  used  by  any  other  team  member.   - The  final  version  of  the  position  paper  will  be  roughly  7  pages  in  length  (before   References),  will  follow  APA  Style  guidelines  for  a  research  paper  (see  Policies),   and  is  due  on  the  Tuesday  following  your  team's  debate.  It  should  incorporate   key  points  from  the  debate  and  have  no  fewer  than  8  references.
