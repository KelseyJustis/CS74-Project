Lats 5/Socy 44 Complexities of Latina/o Identity
Professor Christina Gómez Summer 2014, 10A Silsby 121 ­ 6-0328 Office Hours: Wed: 9 am ­ 12 pm or by appointment _____________________________________________________________________________________
The Latino population currently consists of approximately 53 million people in the United States, or approximately 17% of all Americans; by the year 2060 the U.S. Census estimates that the Latino population will makeup at least 31 percent of the total U.S. population, about 129 million individuals. This course examines the diverse social, economic, political, and cultural histories of those who are now commonly identified as Latinas/os in the United States. The course combines the close reading of required texts with detailed classroom discussion. This course will provide students with the essential tools needed to question, discuss, and examine topics, such as, the social construction of race and ethnicity, identity, immigration, theories of power, colonialism, assimilation, manifest destiny, forms of resistance and social movement activity, urbanization, labor, family, gender issues and relations, race relations, and community social capital. The goal is to have students develop a greater appreciation and understanding of the impact of and the important roles played by Latino men and women in the formation and development of U.S. society. Dist. SOC; WCult: CI. Gómez.
