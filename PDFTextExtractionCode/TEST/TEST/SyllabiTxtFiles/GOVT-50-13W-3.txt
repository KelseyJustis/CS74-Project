SYNOPSIS This course examines instances of political and legal cooperation in response to cases of large scale conflict in the international system. From classical to modern times political and legal thinkers have used various forms of government as a means to create non-violent, enduring, and ultimately, ever advancing civilizations. This course will examine the theories, patterns, and frameworks of governmental forms that have been intended as tools for stabilizing societies. After examining conflicts that arise from nationalism and international anarchy, the class will examine a range of cooperative solutions including federalism, partial independence, partition, as well as presidential, parliamentary, majoritarian, and consociational forms of democracy. Solutions that have been offered for a wide range of territories will also be explored including, the Palestinian Territories, the Kurdish Territories, Puerto Rico, Northern Ireland, and Bosnia.
COURSE WORK AND GRADING The final grade for this course will be based on a research paper abstract (worth 5%), a midterm exam (worth 20%), a research paper (worth 30%), a final exam (worth 30%), and participation (worth 15%).
 The research paper abstract is due at the beginning of class on (1/24).  The midterm will take place on (2/7).  Research paper presentations will take place on (2/20 and 2/27 [During the Wednesday X-
Period] from 3:00-3:50pm)  A draft copy of the research paper is due on (2/20).  The final research paper is due on (3/7).  The final exam will take place on (3/14) at 8:00am
Late assignments will be marked down by one-third of a grade (i.e. from A- to B+) for every day they are late, with the exception of extraordinary reasons. Class attendance is obligatory for the course. Students are strongly encouraged to have studied the required readings beforehand and actively participate in the class. The participation grade will be a measure of the research presentations toward the end of the class and especially the readings-enriched quantity and quality of the comments made in class discussion.
The research paper. The paper should at the outset very clearly state a central argument (thesis) in reaction to material in the lecture or the readings and then draw on evidence to reinforce the thesis. Students will need to read materials that are of interest to them from both the required and suggested readings to gain ideas of possible paper topics. Students are also encouraged to obtain scholarly material outside of the required and suggested readings using sources such as Google Scholar. In response to the scholarly debates and arguments in the literature, you will agree or disagree with the information you encounter. The assignment then requires you to set forth your own ideas of how you believe policies and concepts should be formulated or reformulated. Ultimately you will need to take a position and make an argument that is clear, enriched by the readings, and backed up with evidence. Students will want to express all details, evidence, and facts only as they serve the purposes of their thesis and its supporting sub-arguments--unlike a news or book report that seeks merely to communicate facts and details. In other words, you are discouraged from providing extensive background information or summaries of other works. Instead, such details should be used as they reinforce the arguments as they are made throughout the paper. The quality of your argumentation will also be greatly strengthened

GOVT 50 International Conflict and Cooperation 2
by thinking of the strongest counterarguments to your thesis and refuting them. You should begin work on your research paper as early as possible in the term. Papers should be between 10-11 pages in length. Helpful advice for creating excellent research papers is also clearly described in the Van Evera reading on Blackboard.
Before the research papers are due, you are expected to hand in a research paper abstract (for the due date see above). This assignment will allow you to receive feedback well before your research paper is due later in the term. This assignment needs to include the title of your research paper (which describes the topic). It will also need an abstract of 150 words or less (which articulates the central argument as well as at least one counterargument that will be refuted by your research paper). Lastly, it will need to provide a list of at least five scholarly sources that the research paper will draw on.
Research Paper Presentations. Toward the end of class, each student will need to have completed a preliminary draft of their research paper and present its key arguments and evidence in 5-7 minute presentations. As with the research papers, students are discouraged from providing background information and encouraged to instead focus on articulating the paper's key arguments as well as refuting counterarguments. Presentations can also be improved through the use of visual aids such as handouts, Power Point slides, or writing on the chalkboard. Students who use Power Point are also encouraged to come 5-10 minutes before the start of the class to set up their presentation slides on the class computer. Practicing your presentation beforehand will also assist with your delivery. All students within the class are encouraged to be an active audience and carefully assess the presenter's arguments, proffering their opinions and reactions after the talk for the presenter's response. Students can then use such feedback for further revisions before papers are due.
All assignments will be assessed according to the quality of critical analysis, creativity, clarity, and use of theoretical and empirical support from the literature. Although you are expected to draw on the scholarly literature to enrich the arguments in your papers, the sources that you use must be properly cited to avoid the dangers of plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when an author uses the ideas of another source without proper citations and thereby falsely makes it seem as if it is their own work. Any established citation style will be sufficient as long as it is used consistently throughout the paper. For citation styles you can examine scholarly articles and use them as a model. All papers are expected to be in scholarly format, with a bibliography, title, and thesis statement. The research paper should also have an introduction, body, and conclusion. The papers should be stapled, double-spaced, and have 1.25" margins with 12point script. Page numbers should also be clearly noted.
If you have questions regarding your exams, assignments, or other aspects of the course, please do not hesitate to ask and/or see me at my office hours. For additional peer tutorial assistance with writing, research, and multimedia projects, students may use RWIT, the Student Center for Research, Writing, and Information Technology. To make appointments go to RWIT's appointment scheduler at http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rwit, or drop by the Center in 183 Baker-Berry Library, Level One (next to the Reference area) from 4 to 6 pm and 7 to 10 pm, Sundays through Thursdays.
COURSE TEXTS AND READINGS Among the required material for the course are two books:
 Lijphart, Arend 1999. Patterns of Democracy: Government Forms and Performance in ThirtySix Countries. Yale University Press.
 Sumantra Bose, 2002. Bosnia After Dayton: Nationalist Partition and International Intervention. New York: Oxford University Press.
These books, which are marked on the syllabus with a star symbol (*), are available for purchase at the college bookstore, Barnes and Noble, or Amazon.com. The remainder of the required readings are available on Blackboard.
Students are also generally encouraged to keep up with current events, which can improve the quality of discussion and papers. Four publications are particularly good for current events information: Foreign Affairs, The Economist, The New York Times, and The Washington Post.
