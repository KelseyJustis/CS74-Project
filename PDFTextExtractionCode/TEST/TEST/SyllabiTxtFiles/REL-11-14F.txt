RELIGION 11 Introduction to Religion and Morality: Bioethics

Texts to Buy at Wheelock Books:

Chris Bohjalian, Midwives(Vintage PB) Ronald Munson,Intervention and Reflection: Basic Issues in Medical
Ethics, 9th ed. (Cengage).

(All other required readings are available electronically on the Canvas site for this course, as indicated by superscriptCfor that
reading. Readings on Canvas are listed in the order they appear in the syllabus. One copy each of the Munson and Bohjalian books is on reserve at Baker Library.)

Course Objectives:

One aim of this course is to examine the moral teachings and ethical methods of some of the major religious traditions that have shaped our culture. By focusing on some contemporary issues in bioethics--attitudes toward homosexuality, stem cells, cloning, human genetic engineering, the treatment of impaired newborns, and society's treatment of the dying--we hope to understand and evaluate the contributions of these religious traditions. Beyond this exploration of different teachings, however, lie two more basic questions. How do we reason or think about complex moral questions? And, what does religion bring (or not bring) to morality?

Course Requirements:
1. Four unannouncedshort-answer tests in class. These have one purpose only: to ensure that you keep up with the reading that is essential to class discussion. Each test represents 7% of the course grade and all the tests together constitute 20% of the course grade. Note: this means that you can miss oneof these tests and still receive the full 20% that this course requirement represents. Apart from a writtenDick's House medical excuse or equivalent dean's excuse, there is noexemption from these tests.
2. Presence in class and thoughtful andinformedparticipation in class discussions (quality of contribution counts; not quantity). This requirement is important since a number of class sessions involve cases in biomedical ethics. When indicated by the instructor, cases of readings should be prepared in advance. Class participation constitutes 20% of the course grade.
3. One bioethics essay (30% of the course grade). The purpose of this essay is to develop your ability to analyze ethical and ethico-religious issues with clarity and rigor. The essay is to be based on one of the cases in a list of cases that will be available on Canvas.
Your essay must not exceed 6 pages in length (12 point type Palatino, double-spaced, 1 inch margins) including references or notes. The essay is due as a PDF document in the Bioethics Essay Drop Box of Canvas no later than 5:00 pm, Wednesday Oct. 22. Please place your name and class only on a separate page attached to the very endof the essay. This page does not count toward the 6-page limit.

assigned topic or topics. Your essay must not exceed 6 pages in
length (including references; 12 point Palatino type, double-spaced, 1 inch margins). The essay is due as a PDF document in the Take-Home Final Drop Box on Canvas no later than 5:00 pm, Nov. 23.
