 Security & Privacy: Syllabus & Schedule

CS 55: Fall 2014

For the lectures, each topic will link to lecture notes, which should be available by classtime the day of the lecture. Notes for guest lectures will be provided when possible.
These notes will complement what's presented in class. Given my writing disability, the notes are also there to help you interpret my poor handwriting!
You will be responsible for the lecture notes, the material presented during the lectures, and the assigned reading.
The schedule below may be updated during the term as necessary.
