The purpose of this class will be to explore attempts to study our human 

emotions. What constitutes an emotion ­ How do we define one?  How do we 

measure one?  Is emotion the same for each of us?  Is an aberration in our 

emotional life the basis for psychopathological disorders? We will examine these 

questions by first learning about how the brain detects, identifies, interacts with 

and/or mediates emotion.  This will give us a foundation from which to consider 

these more lofty questions.
