What is this course about?

This course is an introduction to human cognition. We will cover cognitive abilities such as attention, memory, language, and decision making.

What book should I buy?

Reisberg, Cognition: Exploring the Science of the Mind, 5th Edition

What kind of exams should I expect?

Exams will be multiple choice. Yes, that sucks. With a high enrollment, there is no reasonable way to administer and score essay exams.

How will I be graded?

25% Exam I (covers ~ first third of course) 25% Exam II (covers ~ second third of course)
40% Final Exam (covers entire course) 10% Stuff

What the #!@%^$ is Stuff?
"Stuff" is a smorgasbord of short assignments, in-class quizzes, on-line quizzes (if I can get them to work), etc. "Stuff" is a way to reward people for attending class and keeping up with the course work. "Stuff" will be credit/no credit. You will accumulate "Stuff points" as you complete the stuff.

What if I am sick or can't make it to class? What if I miss some stuff?
As a courtesy, please let me know in advance if you know you will be missing a class. This is especially important if you will be absent for an exam. If you become sick or ill, call or email me and seek medical attention. Unless you notify me in advance, or have a valid reason for missing class, you will forfeit any "Stuff points" for that day.
