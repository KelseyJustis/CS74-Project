final  exam  will  be  formatted  similarly  to  the  midterm  and  focus  largely  (although  not  entirely)  on  the  material  
covered  after  the  midterm.    If  you  select  the  research  paper  option,  you  will  write  a  12-18  page  research  paper  on
