Course Description
General Statement: Nationalism is one of the greatest paradoxes of our time. Despite the relentless forces of both cultural and economic globalization, and despite the rise of mass media and instant communications, we are witnessing a revival of nationalism leading to the breakup of the USSR and the Sudan, and challenging the national integrity of other multi-ethnic states ranging from India to Spain, Sri Lanka to Britain and Nigeria to Belgium. Clearly, the conventional wisdom prevailing since World War II: that nationalism, religion, and local particularism will be relegated to relics when confronting the powers of modernity and economic interdependence has failed to occur. Virtually every war that has occurred in the last 60 years was in the name of the "nation"; and the political discourse even within the most "post-national" states of the EU is occurring in the "national" context.

It is the purpose of this course to examine the sources of modern nationalism in its various form and its on-going impact on specific polities as well as the international system
Themes:
The course is divided into two main components.
The first half of the course will focus on the intellectual roots of various forms of nationalism, and nationalism's interactions with major ideological streams of the last century including: Liberalism, Fascism, Communism, and fundamental religious interpretations.
The second half of the class will deal with the impacts of nationalism on current international structures, dealing with issues such as: immigration, multi-culturalism, and globalization.
Requirements:
Each student will be expected to do the assigned readings and take part in class discussion; there may also be occasional quizzes. (10%).
There will be an in-class mid-term exam: (40%)
At the end of the semester the student will have a choice between taking a final exam or writing a research paper (20 pages in length), on a topic approved by the instructor (50%).
