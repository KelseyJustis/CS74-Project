Course Description

This course explores the topic of multiculturalism in the context of contemporary debates in political theory. Students will examine the arguments of authors advocating special political and legal treatment for cultural groups, integrated with responses from liberal, conservative, feminist, and postmodern critics of multiculturalism. The course is designed to provide students with an understanding of central issues in multicultural debates; but its principal aim is to inspire students to think deeply about the principles, values, and institutions that democratic societies might affirm. Among the questions students consider will be the following: Is a multicultural society desirable or workable? Should government provide minority cultures with special recognition, legal exemptions, or group rights? Is multiculturalism bad for women or harmful otherwise? Could any form of multiculturalism adequately emphasize the values of personal autonomy, equality, and fairness? Prerequisite: one course in political theory or political philosophy.

Each of these texts has been ordered and should be available for purchase at Wheelock Books. Required and recommended readings for the course are either contained within the books listed above, or they will be made available by other means. A complete listing of the scheduled readings for Govt. 86.01 is given below.

Format
Govt. 86.01 is a seminar, so it is designed to foster involvement and participation in discussion. Normally, each class will begin with a student presentation on the assigned readings, of 25-30 minutes in duration. The presentations will consist of four elements: (a) an introduction of the authors (where appropriate); (b) an outline of the readings' central arguments and points of interest; (c) a critical assessment of the authors' work, in the selected readings; and (d) the presenter will identify questions that the readings raise, for further consideration. The discussion will then be opened to the seminar as a whole. There is a fair deal of concentrated reading in Govt. 86.01, but it is crucial that you come prepared so that you can make use of the seminar discussions. Please also bring the books and other materials with you, when we discuss them, since we will frequently refer to passages in the texts. If there are changes to be made to the syllabus, or adjustments of other kinds, they will be announced in class.

Students' grades will be comprised of the following three components:

(1) In-class presentation on scheduled readings
