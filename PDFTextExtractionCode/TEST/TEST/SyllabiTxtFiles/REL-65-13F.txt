Course Description
A survey of the origins and development of the culture of athletic competition in America, with roots in
the "Muscular Christianity" movement of nineteenth-century England. We'll examine the peculiar (religious?) passion that Americans invest in sports as well as the role that sports has played as an engine for social change. We look, finally, at some of the ethical issues surrounding
organized sports.

In addition to attendance and informed participation in class discussions (40 points), you will be given a mid-term and final examination (60 points each).
The class includes three ethical debates; by the end of the second week of class, you will sign up for one side or another in each of the debates
(instructor reserves the right to adjust membership in the teams so that they are roughly equal in size). You will prepare your argument with other
members of your team and write it up (8-10 pages); on the day of the debate, each side will have 45 minutes to present its case, using whatever devices its
chooses (arguments, statistics, video, etc.). Every member of the debate team will receive the same grade, an incentive for teamwork (similar to team
sports). Possible 65 points for each debate. The final assignment (55 points)
is a review (6-8 pages) of a book listed on Blackboard, due November 12.
