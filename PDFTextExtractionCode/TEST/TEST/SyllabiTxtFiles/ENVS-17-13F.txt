Course Description
People use the oceans for transportation, recreation, food, mineral wealth, waste disposal, military defense, and many other important things. This course explores the most significant human-ocean interactions known today from two perspectives: science and policy. From the scientific literature, students will learn about issues ranging from the physical effects of sea level rise to the biological impacts of pollution events like the recent BP oil spill to the bioeconomic repercussions of overfishing. For each of the problems that are revealed by science, we will also critically evaluate relevant policy solutions to understand how institutional design can (or can't) enhance human interactions with the oceans.

Course Goals
 Identify ecosystem services and other benefits that humans derive from the oceans  Recognize the major impacts of human activities on the oceans  Understand how multiple impacts interact to amplify problems in the world's oceans  Evaluate domestic and international policies related to the oceans  Analyze the political and economic links between human-oceans interactions and oceans

Teaching & Learning This course is an introduction to oceans issues and policy and is designed to accommodate students with a wide range of academic backgrounds. Each class will focus on a general set of issues, usually tied to a specific ecosystem or biophysical process. Students will first study the processes that shape the coupled human and natural systems associated with a particular topic. This requires learning about many different aspects of each topic, including oceanographic, biological, social, economic, and political elements. Once they understand the topic, students will learn about potential solutions to topic-related problems. These can range from technological fixes to social institutions to government regulations. Readings and homework will give students some understanding of basic concepts or specific cases which will serve as a foundation for broader lectures/discussions in class.

Expectations Exams: There will be two exams for this course. Each will consist of a short answer section (about 20 questions) and a long answer section (pick 3 of 5 questions). Exams are not cumulative except insofar as information learned in the first half of the term is important for understanding material covered in the second half.

Readings: There is one textbook covering oceanography and marine biology for the course. Assigned sections of this book compliment readings from the policy and social science literature. See the schedule for all reading assignments. Policy readings can be found using the first author's name under the Blackboard Library Reserves. It is important that students read all assigned materials for the course. There is a lot of ground to cover and I will not rehash readings during class, though I am happy to answer student's questions about the readings.

Documentaries: Policy can be heavily tied to public perceptions of marine problems, so many conservationists and other interest groups work to make the public more aware of the issues that they think are important. In order to both provide a more visceral understanding of the material covered and to see how different groups represent the issues, students are asked to watch one documentary per week. Assigned documentaries are listed under the x-hour slot in the schedule but can be streamed via the Blackboard Library Reserves any time before class on Friday.

Homework: One essay per week is required (maximum 400 words). Each essay should link the reading assignments for a particular day with a current or historical event. Events can be drawn from newspapers, magazines, or peer reviewed journal sources. The primary goal here is to synthesize the information learned in the readings through application to a specific issue. Essays should be posted on the Blackboard Discussion Board by 9 am on the day of the linked reading assignment. For example, if linking to readings assigned for Monday, September 16th, then the essay should be posted on the discussion board by 9 am that same day. Note that there are not reading assignments on every day of class so please plan ahead. Each essay must cover a different example; it's first come, first serve, so the earlier you post your essay the more leeway you'll have in choosing an illustration. Essays are limited to no more than 400 words, must be well written, and should include appropriate citations/references (references are not included in the word count). Essays are required every week but each student will get 2 freebie essays--that is, I will drop the lowest 2 essay grades for each student.
