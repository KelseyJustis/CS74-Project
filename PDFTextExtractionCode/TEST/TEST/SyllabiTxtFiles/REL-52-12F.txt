Course description
This course tells the story of Cuba's religious formations through their musical genres, and examines the role music has played in celebrating deities, ancestors, and community. We explore the relationship between dance, spirit possession, and mythology, as well as the construction of nation, race, and gender through music. Among the music to be considered is that of the all-male secret society Abakuá; initiatory traditions of Lucumí and Palo Monte; Haitian Tumba Francesa; and Havana-based hip-hop.

The professor reserves the right to fail/withhold credit for the course unless all of the assignments have been turned in on time. Academic Integrity Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Use your own words, and credit the origins of the facts and ideas used in your writing. This applies to any text found on the internet. Do not cut and paste sentences from elsewhere and insert them into your own papers. You must acknowledge all borrowings using a standard citation format, properly followed. I reserve the right to use the anti-plagiarism software www.turnitin.com to ensure that the writings you submit are yours alone, but passages from your work can also be easily "Googled" to confirm the same. WARNING: Websites are notoriously poor sources of information about African religions of the Americas. They tend to be outdated, stereotyped, or simply incorrect; therefore, plagiarizing--that is, stealing--from the web exposes you not only to failure of the class but also innumerable and profound factual errors!
