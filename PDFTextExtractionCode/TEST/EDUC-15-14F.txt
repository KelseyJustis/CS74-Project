Course Description

In this course we will learn about the foundational theories that have influenced the study of human development and learning throughout recent history. Readings and discussions will provide an indepth historical lens onto key conceptual approaches to the study of human development and learning including Bronfenbrenner, Freire, Behaviorism, Social Learning, Information Processing, Situated Cognition, Multiple Intelligences, Freud, Erickson, Piaget, Vygotsky, Nativism, and Mind, Brain and Education. This course aims to explain the historical origins of current trends in the study of human development, learning and education. We will explore the nuances of each theory and discuss applications to classroom settings.

Course Goals

Upon completion of this course, you will be able to (a) summarize, (b) compare and contrast, and (c) evaluate the major theories of human development and learning. The student will be able to identify and evaluate ways in which these theories have been/could be used in a classroom setting. Throughout, the student will gain a better understanding of his or her own educational experiences and develop a personal, evidence-based theory of learning and development.

Required Readings
The majority of the readings for this course are scientific articles or excerpts that have been posted on Canvas via electronic reserves. To access the readings, go to the course Canvas site and click on the `Library Reserves/Guides' button located near the bottom of the left hand column.
We will also read various chapters from the following text:

Description of Course Requirements
1. Participation and Attendance This is a seminar style course. Participation is essential. It is expected that the required readings are completed before you come to class and you are prepared to comment, question, discuss, and/or critique them. Missing class regularly will affect your participation grade, as you cannot participate if you are not present.
2. Discussion Questions You will each be assigned one class during the term to come up with two discussion questions related to the readings. You need to email me your discussion questions by 4:00 p.m. the night before your assigned due date. You also need to type bulleted notes about your own thoughts/answers related to the questions you generate (about 1 page of bulleted notes per question). You need to turn in a hard copy of your questions and brief bulleted notes in class. During class, you will formally pose your discussion questions to the class and facilitate a brief discussion.
3. Empirical Article Search and Summary You will each be assigned one class during the term when you will need to locate a peer-reviewed empirical article that is in some way related to the theory covered in class that day. (Please do not select a review article.) You will need to bring one copy of the article with you to class. You will need to write a 1-2 page overview of the article that 1) summarizes the hypotheses, methods, findings, and conclusions and 2) explicitly explains how it supports or challenges the theory covered in class that day. In class, you will concisely present your paper (in less than 5 minutes). I recommend practicing before class.
4. Bronfenbrenner Analysis & Map Create a visual map of your current environments as a Dartmouth student using Bronfenbrenner's model. The theory calls for information at multiple levels: individual (gender, ethnicity, social class and so forth plus any developmentally instigative qualities you have), microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Add to this some notion of the chronosystem (that is, the effects of chronological and historical time) on your experience. I will share a map depicting my ecological system in class for you to use as a sample, although I encourage you to create your own visual interpretation of Bronfenbrenner's theory.
Attach this map to a brief (3-4 page) paper in which you analyze your nested environments in terms of Bronfenbrenner's ecology theory. Do not just put into words what is pictured on the map. Instead, analyze and evaluate your map in terms of its primary developmental and anti-developmental qualities. For instance, human ecology theory states that positive developmental ecologies include microsystems with proximal processes that call for increased complexity, optimal environmental niches, and a reinforcing, coherent mesosystem. Anti-developmental ecologies, on the other hand, include exosystem factors that inhibit microsystem involvement, problematic chronosystem effects, or individual instigative qualities that lead to avoiding complexities. These are just examples of the kind of theoretical analysis you might conduct; I urge you to think about other theoretical aspects of your own ecology. Due Fri Sept 26th.
5. Case Study Report I will post a set of diverse and realistic case studies on Canvas, each with a set of questions. You will choose one of these case studies. You will need to answer the corresponding questions in a 2-page response. Your answers should contain a logical, well-reasoned analysis with correct use of terms and principles. Remember that sometimes there is more than one effective analysis of a situation. Clarifying your reasons for reaching your conclusions is as important as reaching the conclusions. Specific instructions will be provided in class. Due Wed Nov 12th.

6. `This I Believe' Essay `This I Believe' was a daily radio show hosted by Edward R. Murrow from 1951-1955 that reached 39 million listeners. Americans- both well known and unknown- read brief essays about their personal philosophy on life. They shared insights about individual values that shaped their daily actions.
During this course, it is my hope that you will begin to develop your own theory of learning, education, and human development. You will write a 350-500 word `This I Believe' essay that highlights at least one aspect of the personal theory you begin to develop. Your essay should reflect your personal theory and must be- in some way- directly related to the content of this course. `This I Believe' has writing guidelines posted at http://thisibelieve.org/guidelines/ that you must follow. To summarize these guidelines, you must tell a story, be brief, name your belief, be positive, and be personal. I urge you to listen to numerous `This I Believe' essays before attempting to write your own (Downloaded for free at http://thisibelieve.org/podcasts/ ). Specific details will be provided in class. Due Mon Nov 17th.
7. Exams There will be two exams. The first exam will take place on Wed Oct 15th and cover material from the first half of the class. The final exam will take place on Tue Nov 25th at 8:00 a.m. and will be cumulative. The exams will include a variety of assessment formats and will be based on the required readings and in-class discussions.
Course Requirements and Grading
Participation: 8% Bronfenbrenner Analysis and Map: 12.5% This I Believe Essay: 12.5% Discussion Questions: 5% Empirical Article: 5% Case Study: 10% Exam 1: 22% Exam 2: 25%
Late Policy
A hard copy of all assignments must be handed in at the beginning of class on the date indicated on the syllabus. Assignments handed in after class will be counted as one day late. Ten points will be deducted from the grade of any assignment turned in one day late and an additional five points will be deducted for each additional day that passes. (Please note the use of the word `day', not `class'.)
You are responsible for turning in assignments even if you cannot be in class on the day they are due. If you cannot be in class, you are responsible for getting me a hard copy by the beginning of class. In most cases, email versions will not be accepted.
RWIT: The Student Center for Research, Writing, and Information Technology
RWIT is a free service dedicated to helping students develop more effective strategies for generating and organizing ideas, finding and evaluating research sources, and revising compositions. At RWIT, you can meet one-on-one with a tutor to discuss a paper, research project, or assignment. Whether you are brainstorming, drafting, or polishing, the tutors can provide feedback that will help improve your work. This is a wonderful service that you are lucky to have as a Dartmouth student. Take advantage of it. To make an appointment, please see http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rwit/students/appointment.html

Students with Disabilities Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to see me privately as early as possible in the term. Students requiring disability-related accommodations must register with the Student Accessibility Service office. Once SAS has authorized accommodations, students must show the originally signed SAS Accommodations/Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions about accommodations will remain confidential. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.
Religious Observations Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
Academic Honor Principle You are expected to familiarize yourself with and uphold all aspects of the Academic Honor Principle. See the ORC Bulletin or http://www.dartmouth.edu/~uja/honor for the official statement. You may not receive or provide assistance on any exam. All work must be your own and submitted only for this class. Plagiarism is the submission or presentation of work, in any form, that is not your own, without acknowledgment of the source. You must cite all sources according to the formal APA guidelines. I take the Academic Honor Principle seriously and expect you to do the same.
