Course Description
This course is an introduction to international politics, the study of relations between governments and politics at the global level. This is the foundation course in international relations at Dartmouth, providing a survey introduction to foreign policy, security studies, international political economy, and international organization. In this course we will learn how scholars are developing scientific explanations of phenomena such as interstate war, civil war, alliances, economic globalization, regional economic, environmental, and human rights organizations, UN peacekeeping successes and failures, and transnational non-governmental organization (NGO) influence.
The central learning objectives in this course are as follows:
 To understand what does and does not constitute a scientific explanation in the field of international politics;
 To be familiar with the most important theories and debates in international politics;
 To be able to evaluate the logical coherence of theories and arguments in international politics;
 To understand why scholars use certain types of evidence to test hypotheses in international politics.
Course Requirements
Readings
All readings listed on the syllabus are required. You must do all the reading for a particular class meeting before that class.
Most of the reading comes from our textbook, but there will also be some supplemental readings posted to Blackboard. The textbook is available at the bookstore and at many fine online vendors:
 Frieden, Jeffry A., David A. Lake, & Kenneth A. Schultz. 2012. World Politics: Interests, Interactions, Institutions (2nd ed.). New York: W. W. Norton.
Remember to bring to class all the readings assigned for a particular day. That means that you will need to print out Blackboard readings.

Assignments
Class will combine lectures and group-based discussion, and attendance is required. Your grade is based on your performance on the following assignments.
Homework Assignments
The class will be divided into an even number of teams, with the number of teams to be determined by enrollment. Homework questions will be assigned on a once-weekly basis to each team. Each team will prepare answers to the homework questions on the team's discussion forum on Blackboard, which I will monitor. Teams are encouraged to divide questions among team members. They should bring their answers to class for discussion but should not turn these answers in to me. For grading purposes, I will evaluate each team member's individual contribution to the online discussion. Your participation grade in your team's forum accounts for 25% of your final course grade.
Midterm Examination
There will be an in-class, essay midterm on Wednesday October 16. The purpose of the midterm is to allow you the opportunity to organize and present what you have learned on the material covered in class to that point. Your midterm grade accounts for 20% of your final course grade.
Team Debates
At the end of the semester, there will be in-class team debates on assigned topics. Again, team participants will be graded individually. The basis of your grade is your level of preparation for your presentation. Students should also turn in a 1000-word (roughly two pages) summary of what they intend to say in the debate. Your debate grade accounts for 15% of your final course grade.
Final Exam
There will be a take-home final essay exam, due Tuesday November 26 at 4 PM (the final day of final exams). The take-home exam will allow you some scope for critical reflection on what you have learned throughout the semester. The final exam will be cumulative but weighted toward the post-midterm half of the course. It will consist of three short essays, each of which should be around three or four pages in length. The final exam accounts for the remaining 40% of your grade.
