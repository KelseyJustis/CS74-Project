Course Description
The Nazi movement created one of the most radical revolutions in modern history. After overthrowing Germany's democratic system, the Nazis energetically and ruthlessly altered Germany and Europe, bringing exciting opportunities for some and horrific repression for others. The Third Reich inaugurated new economic prosperity, created new cultures and aesthetics, introduced new concepts of citizenship and political comradeship, and mobilized millions of Germans of diverse backgrounds. It also created an extremely repressive and violent dictatorship, advanced brutal anti-Semitism, enslaved minorities and political opponents, unleashed the most destructive war in modern history, and orchestrated the systematic extermination of Europe's Jewry. The legacies of its short twelve years in power continued to shape politics, international law, and culture throughout the twentieth century.
This seminar will explore the origins, nature, and consequences of Nazism. First, we will explore its historical roots: what were the ideological, social, and political origins of Nazism? How coherent and systematic was Nazi ideology, and what were the experiences that shaped it? How unique were Nazi ideas in early 20th century Germany? Second, we will discuss the different ways in which the Nazi regime transformed Germany: how did the Nazis succeed in mobilizing so many Germans to actively support the new regime? What were the characteristics of the Nazi system, and why did it continue to radicalize over time? What were the limits and obstacles to its authority? Finally, we will discuss the Third Reich's path to and conduct of WWII: what were the Nazi goals in unleashing war, and how did they change? How did the Holocaust unfold, and what is the best way to explain and understand this mass trauma? Drawing on a wide variety of sources, this seminar will explore some of the key cultural, social, and political trends that intersected in the Nazi era.
Course Requirements and Grades:
This seminar aims to develop a variety of skills:
1

1. The mastery of facts and concepts. 2. The ability to assess and interpret various sources (both primary and secondary, visual
and textual). 3. The ability to express ideas and opinions (both in writing and in class).
You will be assessed on all of these skills. For this purpose, the course includes several different requirements:
1. Attendance and participation (30%): As this is a seminar course, class participation comprises a substantial proportion of your grade. Attendance at every session is required, and I expect you to come prepared to discuss the readings and to engage with your colleagues. In addition, you are expected to post two questions, thoughts, or comments that you had about the assigned readings for one of the week's two sessions ­ you will be divided in two groups, one group will be in charge of posting for the Tuesday class, the second group in charge of posting for the Thursday class. Those postings are intended to be informal observations to help spark our discussions. They are due at 12 AM on the night before class. You must post these under "class discussion" on Blackboard, and will be part of your overall participation grade.
2. Research paper (55%): As a culmination of this seminar, you will prepare a final research paper (25-30 pages) on some aspect of Nazism. You may choose a topic of interest to you in consultation with Prof. Greenberg, and are expected to incorporate both primary and secondary sources.
In order to facilitate to process of defining a topic, identifying relevant sources, and composing your research paper, there will be several steps and assignments during the term. Prof. Greenberg will provide further explanation for each of these steps:
A. You must schedule a required meeting with Prof. Greenberg to discuss potential topics; this must take place by the end of the week 3, Friday, January 25.
B. Written topic description (about one page) and bibliography (at least three primary sources and three secondary sources), due Sunday, February 3, 7 PM. This description will count as 5% of the grade of your final paper.
C. Primary source analysis, in which you analyze one of the primary sources you will be using for the paper, its main arguments and value for your paper, due Tuesday, February 12, 7 PM. This analysis will count as 15% of the grade of your final paper, 7.5% of your final grade.
D. Research Paper outline that lays out the central argument, the sections, and the key sources of the paper (about 3 pages), due Sunday, February 17, 7 PM. This outline will count as 5% of the grade of your final paper.
The first draft of the paper is due Saturday March 2nd at 7 PM; the final version is due Tuesday March 12th at 7 PM.
2

3. Peer review session (15%): During the 9th week of class (February 24-28), we will meet in three small groups to discuss the first drafts of your research papers. Each student will submit their draft to both Prof. Greenberg and four other students, who will review it in detail (based on guidelines provided by Prof. Greenberg), and will offer constructive suggestions for improvement. These suggestions are to be submitted to Prof. Greenberg on Monday March 4th at 4:30.
Course Readings:
The vast majority of the readings, both primary and secondary sources, will be available via Blackboard under "course materials." In addition, you are expected to purchase the following three books:
1. Richard Evans, The Coming of the Third Reich (New York: Penguin, 2003) 2. Richard Evans, The Third Reich in Power (New York: Penguin, 2006). 3. Jan T. Gross, Neighbors. The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne,
Poland (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001).
Course Policies
Writing:
All written material should be submitted in 12 point Times New Roman Font, double-spaced, with 1 inch margins. Sources must be cited in footnotes. Submissions are accepted via upload on Blackboard. You may not email me your paper. For guidelines on writing and citing sources, see the short citation guide provided on the course website on Blackboard.
All submitted written material must be your own work and must conform to the Dartmouth honor code (see http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/acad-honor.html). If you have questions about citing the work of others in your paper, please come see me before submitting your work.
Note on late submissions:
All assignments must be submitted in time. Any late submission will penalize your participation grade by 20 points (for example, from 90 to 70), and will reduce your final grade. If you know you will need an extension, you must contact Professor Greenberg well in advance. Last minute requests will not be approved.
Attendance:
You are expected to attend all classes. Any absence from a class will result in a reduction of your overall participation grade. Students who would fail to attend more than two classes will result in a zero grade on your participation, and will severely reduce your final grade.
