Course Description
This course is about the art of designing efficient algorithms for a wide range of fundamental computational tasks and the science of proving the correctness of such algorithms and formally analyzing their time complexity.
The course will introduce the following basic design paradigms: divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, amortized analysis, and randomization. The computational tasks studied will span several domains. These include sorting and order statistics, computing with integers and number-theoretic algorithms, algorithms on graphs, and geometric algorithms.
Writing mathematical proofs will be required throughout this course. Students are expected to have previous experience with writing proofs. Taking CS 30 will provide this experience.
Students will be expected to be experienced programmers before taking this course, so that they are able to reason about algorithms/code at a high level without seeing actual lines of code in front of them. Taking the CS 1 ­ CS 10 sequence will provide this experience.

Announcements

Schedule, Homeworks, Exams

This is a work in progress. The dates for the quizzes, the evening midterms and due dates for the homework sets and the final exam are now fixed as shown below. This schedule will be updated frequently. Please check back often, and please remember to RELOAD to get the latest schedule. The schedule is subject to change, with minimal notice. Especially, greyed-out entries should be considered tentative. Please be sure to read and understand the Homework Grading Guidelines and the Late Submission Policy. Official solutions to homeworks and exams (hard-copy only) will be given out when graded work is returned.

About the Exams
Quizzes will be held in class. They will be closed-book and closed-notes. Students must not consult any sources at all when working on a quiz.
Evening Midterms will be held from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. on the days and at the locations marked in the above schedule. These will be open book and open notes. A student may consult the official textbook, any materials handed out in class, his or her own notes, and his or her own graded homework and previous exams/quizzes. No other sources may be consulted. Pay attention to the honor code.
The Final Exam will be available on this website (login required) on the last day of classes. It will be a take-home exam and must be submitted within 48 hours of downloading (very specific instructions will be included in the exam). This exam will be open book and open notes. A student may consult the official textbook, any materials handed out in class, his or her own notes, and his or her own graded homework and previous exams/quizzes. No other sources may be consulted.
