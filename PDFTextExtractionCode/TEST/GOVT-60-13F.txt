Course Description
This course examines the nature and validity of arguments about vexing moral issues in public policy. Students examine a number of basic moral controversies in public life, focusing on different frameworks for thinking about justice and the ends of politics. The primary aim of the course is to provide each student with an opportunity to develop his/her ability to think in sophisticated ways about morally difficult policy issues. Among the questions students address will be the following: Are policies that permit torture justifiable under any circumstances? Do people have basic moral claims to unequal economic holdings and rewards, or should economic distribution be patterned for the sake of social justice? Should people be permitted to move freely between countries? Is abortion wrong in theory or in practice, and in what ways should it be restricted?

Required Readings
There will be a course text as well as other reading materials for PBPL 42. The required text for the course is as follows:
Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson (eds.), Ethics and Politics: Cases and Comments, fourth edition (Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth, 2006) [ISBN: 0-534-62645-9]
This text has been ordered and is available for purchase at Wheelock Books. Required readings for the course are either contained within the Gutmann and Thompson text, or they are listed below in the course schedule. All course materials not contained in the Gutmann and Thompson text will be made available through Blackboard, or placed on reserve at the Baker Reserve Desk.

Format
PBPL 42 is not simply a lecture course, since lectures will be joined by in-class discussion in which you are invited to participate. Normally, there will be a period of lecturing at the outset of each class, following which the floor will be opened to discussion. Classes will focus on specific readings (described below in the course schedule), with different works examined in each successive week. There is a good deal of involved reading in this course,

but it is crucial that you come prepared so that you can make use of the lectures and the discussions with your cohort. Please also bring the Gutmann and Thompson book and your other readings with you, when we discuss them, since we will frequently refer to passages in the texts. If there are changes to be made to the syllabus, or adjustments of other kinds, they will be announced in class.
