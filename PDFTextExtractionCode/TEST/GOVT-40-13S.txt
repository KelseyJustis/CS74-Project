The Politics of Israel and Palestine
Prof. Bernard Avishai, bavishai@gmail.com, 603 748 9040
Dartmouth College, Department of Government, Spring Quarter, 2013
Introduction
This course explores the century-old conflict as seen from the political structures and changing narratives of Israelis and Palestinians. We shall begin by looking at the espoused purposes of the historic Zionist movement and the responses of the Palestinian Arab community to it. We shall look, in parallel, at the formation of the Arab national movement as a whole--and within this, the claims of Palestinians--and especially responses to imperial activity, before and after the British Mandate. We'll then consider the founding of the state of Israel and the formation of the post-1948 Palestinian national movement.
We shall focus thereafter on the aftermath of the 1967 war, the start of the Israeli occupation, and the latter's impact on Israeli institutions, its economy, and its political parties. We'll look correspondingly at the formation and strategies of the Palestine Liberation Organization and, thence, to the founding of Hamas. We shall look, finally, at contemporary political and economic developments in light of the global forces operating on the region, and consider the plausibility of a two-state solution.
Course Requirements
The class will run as a series of structured discussions based on assigned reading. Attendance is compulsory. Prof. Avishai will call on students by name and expect informed judgments; students cannot learn from one another if other students fail to show up in class or fail to read the assignments.
Examinations are meant to stimulate team-based learning. Thus, examinations will conform to the following format: A set number of examination questions will be passed out in advance of each exam; a specific number of questions will be drawn at random and all students will answer the questions chosen. It is expected that students will form study groups and divide up the labor involved in preparing thoughtful answers. However, students will be judged individually.
Students will also have to write a 15-page research paper, to be handed in the final day of class.
All exams will be closed book and students will be permitted only one page of handwritten notes. The mid-term will be worth 20%, the final 50%, and the paper 30%. Failure to participate in class discussion, or unexcused absences, will produce a penalty of up to 10%.
