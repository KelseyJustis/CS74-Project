GODDESSES OF INDIA

COURSE DESCRIPTION
The goddesses of ancient and modern India are complex and ambiguous deities. India's Hindu goddesses play roles as divergent as those of loving mother, adoring wife, and haggish Death, as well as Creator and Supreme Force enlivening all creation. This course will use both elite and popular Hindu religious texts in conjunction with contemporary sociological and anthropological accounts, scholarly analyses, visual art, and film to explore the diverse identities and roles of India's many goddesses, their mythologies, their cults, and their associated ritual practices. As we examine various goddesses and their cults, we will also look at the lives of Indian women, paying close attention to how the belief in a divine feminine functions both to empower women and to limit women's power within Indian society. To understand the relationship between goddesses and women, we will explore such topics as sati (widow burning), spirit possession, and women's rituals and songs.

Unit II: The Great Goddess, the Independent Goddess: Devi and the Devi Mahatmya
The Devi Mahatmya is a foundational text for Indian goddess-worship and the earliest elite Sanskrit text to put forth a vision of the Goddess (here called Devi) as creator and sustainer of the entire universe, supreme over all male gods. In this unit, we will read the Devi Mahatmya and discuss the nature of Devi as an independent goddess and the philosophical concepts and ideas that underlie a goddess-centered worldview (e.g., concepts such as shakti, prakriti, and maya).

Unit III: The Goddess as Consort: Three Types of Consort Relationship
In contrast to Devi (a supreme goddess who is independent of all male gods and superior to all male gods), many other Indian goddesses are envisioned in terms of the relationships they have with various male deities of the Hindu pantheon. In an influential article, Frederique Apffel Marglin has formulated a typology of three different types of such "consort" relationships: (1) a relationship in which the male is dominant and the female is subordinate; (2) a relationship in which the male and female are roughly equal in status; and (3) a relationship in which the female constitutes the dominant partner. Each type of relationship involves different philosophical notions and conveys a different religious world-view. In this unit, we will discuss these three different types of consort relationship (as well as the question of how marriage fits into the picture), and then turn our attention to four different case-studies illustrating these different types.

Unit IV: The Independent Goddess Once Again: Village Goddesses
In this unit, we will turn away from the elite Sanskritic tradition to examine another type of Hindu goddess--the rural village goddess who presides over the world of the village and the life and death of its villagers, and who constitutes perhaps the primary focus of devotion for millions of rural Indians.

Unit V: Goddesses and Women
In this unit, we will examine the complex relationship between goddesses and actual women. We will do this by looking at a number of different questions: What is the role and status of women in traditional Hinduism? What are the basic characteristics of Hindu women's religiosity? How does the belief in a divine feminine serve both to empower and to restrict women in Indian society? How do Hindu women use goddesses and goddess-worship both to conform to patriarchal Indian values and to resist them? And what is the dividing line between goddesses and women? Can goddesses become women? Can women become goddesses?
