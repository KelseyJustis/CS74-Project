BIO 11: The Science of Life
Why can't we all just get along? Cooperation and Conflict across the Biological Sciences
Winter 2012 Lectures:10A Tu & Th 1000-1150: x-hour: W 1500-1550
Mark A. McPeek 022 Class of 1978 Life Sciences Center Office Hours: Tuesday, Thursday 0800-0930 & 1200-1400 or by appointment

This course has three goals: The first is to introduce you to a major problem in the biological sciences, namely how cooperation and conflict are manifested at various levels of biological organization. The second it to survey the various ways that biologists address that problem and what various solutions to the problems that have developed at different hierarchies in biological organization and in different groups of organisms through the processes of evolution. And the third (and most important one) is to stimulate your thinking about these and many other problems in an evolutionary framework. Also, along the way you will learn a lot of biology and see how biologists apply what they know to new problems.

Textbook: Reece, J. B., M. R. Taylor, E. J. Simon, and J. L. Dickey, K. A. Hogan. 2012. Biology: Concepts and connections. 8th edition. Pearson/Benjamin Cummins, San Francisco. (other recent editions will work just fine as well. They don't change much.)

Grading: Grades will be based on three quizzes and a final exam. The quizzes will count as 20% of the grade each, and the final for 40%. The quizzes will be scheduled in the X-Hour. The final exam is cumulative. Both will be short answer/essay exams, with questions requiring from a few sentences to a few paragraphs to answer.

Students with Disabilities: I encourage students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities to discuss what appropriate accommodations might be helpful to them. Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak to me by the end of the second week of the term, all discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Disabilities Coordinator may be consulted to verify the documentation of the disability.

Religious Holidays: Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in this course, please meet with us before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

The Honor Principle: Academic honesty is essential. The following is quoted directly from the Dartmouth College Student Handbook: "Fundamental to the principle of independent learning are the requirements of honesty and integrity in the performance of academic assignments, both in the classroom and outside. Dartmouth operates on the principle of academic honor, without proctoring of examinations. Students who submit work that is not their own or who commit other acts of academic dishonesty forfeit the opportunity to continue at Dartmouth." The complete text of the Academic Honor Principle is in the Student Handbook. Please read it

carefully. Any violations of the Honor Principle within the context of Biology 11 will be referred to the Committee on Standards. The quizzes and the final examination must be completed without reference to written materials other than those provided with the quiz/exam and must be completed without communication with anyone else (the only permissible exception is that students may request clarification of any exam question from the course instructor who is present expressly for that purpose). The answers that you provide must be entirely your own work.
