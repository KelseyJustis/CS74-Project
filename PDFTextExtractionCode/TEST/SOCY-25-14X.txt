DARTMOUTH COLLEGE Department of Sociology
Sociology 25: Democracy and Democratization Summer 2014

Professor Misagh Parsa Office: Room 106 Silsby Phone: x3166

Office Hours: MWF 9-10 am

The road to democratization in most countries in recent years has been marked by large-scale social movements. This course will begin with an examination of various theories of democracy and democratization. It will specifically analyze the role of economic development, capitalism, class, ideology, and religion in the democratization process. In the second half of the term, we study the political upheavals and developments in Iran and the Philippines. The two countries experienced large-scale insurgencies in the 1970s and the 1980s that gave rise to very different political structures and institutions. The contrasting outcomes of the conflicts in the countries provide useful ground for applying and examining alternative theories of democratization.
