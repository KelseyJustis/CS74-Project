PSYCH 46: CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE

COURSE DESCRIPTION

SPRING 2013

This course focuses on cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the
development and function of the nervous system. This includes aspects of gene expression (transcription, mRNA metabolism) and cell biology (cellular transport and
cytoskeleton, cell cycle, signal transduction, and signaling pathways) as they pertain to neurons and glia. Lectures supplemented by in-class discussion of primary
research articles will also serve as an introduction to microscopic, electrophysiological, molecular biological, and genetic techniques, as well as the animal models used to
study the nervous system and neurological disorders.

CLASS MEETING TIME AND LOCATION

This class meets MWF from 11:15 am to 12:20 pm in the Moore building, Room 202, with lectures and/or optional review sessions held during some of the X hours (Tuesdays from 12:00 pm-12:50 pm). There is no class on Memorial Day (May 27th).

INSTRUCTOR

Robert A. Maue, Ph.D. Professor of Physiology and of Biochemistry, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth
Adjunct Professor of Psychology and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College Adjunct Professor of Biological Sciences, Dartmouth College
Office Hours: Tuesdays (12:00-1:00) and Wednesdays (12:30-1:30) in Moore 141B E-mail: Robert.Maue@Dartmouth.edu

COURSE MATERIALS / RESOURCES

Textbooks: There is no single textbook for this course. Instead, information is drawn
from research articles, reviews and a number of well-regarded neuroscience textbooks (listed below). While some of these books may be on reserve, the corresponding
reading from them will be on the Blackboard site. Letter(s) preceding the title of the textbook correspond to the abbreviations used in the syllabus.

Blackboard: The Blackboard site for this course will include Powerpoint slides, accompanying reading material, and research papers. PBS 46 Study Group: For those interested, the Academic Skills Center (Holly Potter) can help students develop a Study Group. Contact Holly for details.
EVALUATION
Three "in class", written exams will be given (the last exam is NOT cumulative). Grades will be determined by the percentage of the total points possible (300), and not on a curve (the entire class could receive an A, an E, or anything in between). While 90% or above will definitely be an "A" and more than 60% will be required to pass the course, the grades associated with the remainder of the scores may be adjusted slightly depending upon the overall difficulty of the exams. Typical (but not necessarily final) percentages and corresponding grades are: >90 (A); 86-89 (A/B+); 80-85 (B); 76-79 (B-/C+); 70-75 (C); 66-69 (C-); 61-65 (D); <60 (E).
HONOR PRINCIPLE
During this course it is expected that students will abide by the Honor Principle. The Dartmouth College Student Handbook (page iii) states "Fundamental to the principle of independent learning are the requirements of honesty and integrity in the performance of academic assignments, both in the classroom and outside. Dartmouth operates on the principle of academic honor, without proctoring of examinations. Students who submit work which is not their own or who commit other acts of academic dishonesty forfeit the opportunity to continue at Dartmouth." If you have any questions regarding this during the course, please contact Dr. Maue.
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
Students with disabilities, including invisible disabilities such as chronic illnesses and learning disabilities, are encouraged to arrange for accommodations that might be helpful to them. Please meet with Dr. Maue as soon as possible, preferably during the first week of class, to discuss possible accommodations. All discussions will be confidential, although the Academic Skills Center may be consulted to verify the documentation of the disability.
STUDENTS' RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please contact Dr. Maue as soon as possible, preferably before the end of the second week of the term, to discuss appropriate accommodations. All discussions will be confidential.
