The policy for missed exams is very stringent. For those few individuals who absolutely cannot take the exam for legitmate reasons (e.g. serious illness), a specific agreement must be made with the instructor of teaching assisant prior to the exam date to make the exam up. If a student misses an exam without a proper excuse, a grade of zero will result.
