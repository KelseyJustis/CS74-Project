SPANISH 2
Course Description Spanish 2 (Intermediate Spanish I) is a continuation of Spanish 1 and as such continues with the study of the fundamentals of Spanish as a spoken and written language. Students will study more complex grammatical structures, and by the end of the course will have gained a global understanding of the major grammatical structures of Spanish. The requirements for the course include intensive oral practice ­ in class and in the virtual language lab ­ and intensive reading and writing practice. Short readings are integrated into the curriculum in order to provide cultural information and to foster vocabulary and reading strategy development. Composition writing will complement the reading selections and will provide exposure to the writing and self-editing process. The goal of this course is to gain intermediate proficiency in reading, writing, speaking and listening in the Spanish language and to engage the student in a preliminary investigation of Hispanic cultures.
Course Objectives:
By the end of the term, students who successfully complete Spanish 2 should be able to:
· Handle successfully a variety of uncomplicated communicative tasks in straightforward social situations (Intermediate ­Low on the ACTFL scale).
· Understand sentence-length utterances, which consist of combinations of learned utterances on a variety of topics (Intermediate ­Low on the ACTFL scale).
· Read consistently with full understanding simple connected texts (Intermediate ­High on the ACTFL scale).
· Meet most practical writing needs and understand limited social demands texts (Intermediate ­High on the ACTFL scale).
As a student in this course, you may have to review on your own grammar topics not reviewed in this course. Your textbook book will be a helpful resource. In addition, there are other online resources listed on our department web site at: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~spanport/resources/
GENERAL INFORMATION · Attendance: Classes are held 4 days a week; drills meet 3 days a week (Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays). Attendance to all class and drill sessions is mandatory. Every absence after two (class and drill combined) will lower your Final Grade. Three tardies are equal to one full absence. If you miss class, you are responsible for finding out what went on, including announcements, changes to the syllabus, and assignments. Athletes in season should meet with their professors after class on the first day of classes to review expectations and class attendance.
· Class Preparation: Students should thoroughly prepare for each day's class by studying all material indicated on the syllabus for that day BEFORE coming to class as

any of it may serve as a discussion topic or be present in quizzes. Only workbook exercises completed and submitted online by the stipulated dates and times will receive chapter assignment credit.
· Drills: Drill sessions are scheduled at 7:45am and 1:45pm. Each student will register at the beginning of the term for one of these sessions and attend that session on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday throughout the term.
· Class / Drill Participation: In addition to attendance to and preparation for all classes, your willingness to contribute, your personal effort and progress are taken into consideration in the participation grade. See below, *Notes on Participation. Efforts to communicate with classmates respectfully and meaningfully in Spanish and to listen carefully to fellow students are of utmost importance. There may be random testing of the material assigned for the day that will also be part of your grade. No gum, no eating during class, no hats.
· Workbooks: All of the automatic feedback electronic workbook (cuaderno) exercises are to be completed and submitted online by 11:59 p.m. on the date due, as specified in syllabus, in order to receive credit.
· Compositions: Compositions will be written in class. The topics will be provided the day of the composition.
· Video materials: Around the sixth week, students will view an entire movie, and the professor will choose specific scenes to address in class. Discussion of the movie will take place in class, and the themes will be incorporated into composition topics and exam questions. All needed background materials will be provided by the professor.
· Reading materials: Students will read a short detective novel beginning the fourth week of classes: Una estrella en peligro. Discussion of the novel will take place in class, and the themes will be incorporated into composition topics and exam questions. All needed background materials will be provided by the professor.
· Oral Presentations: In pairs, students will present a 5- 6-minute presentation at the end of the term. Further guidelines will be presented after the mid-term period.
· Written Exams: There will be two scheduled exams and a final exam, all of which will focus on the cultural materials (including the video materials) and vocabulary and grammar covered in class. Exams will be hand-written in class in INK. No student will be allowed to take an exam on a date other than that scheduled without a letter from a physician or a coach. No postponements of any exams. The Final Exam must be taken on the scheduled date.
· Final Grade: Your final grade will be determined as follows:
Class Participation ............................. 25%
(Attendance, drill and workbook exercises)
Exams .............................................. 30%
Compositions ..................................... 10%
Oral Exam ......................................... 10%

Notes on Class participation: Students are expected to come to class having prepared ALL materials assigned. In class, students must participate actively speaking in group activities and class discussions. Missing class lowers the participation grade. Active Participation in class will be graded as follows:

A: Excellent participation (the student answers questions and offers interesting comments without the need of the professor calling on him/her. The comments and answers show that the student is well prepared, completed and understood the assignment).
B: Good participation (the student answers questions and offers interesting comments whenever the professor calls on him/her. Sometimes, the student participates without being asked. The comments and answers show that the student is prepared and understood the assignment).
C: Fair participation (the student answers questions and offers comments only when the professor calls on him/her. The comments and answers show that the student prepared or attempted to complete the assignment, but doesn't seem to understand it all).
D: Poor participation (the student answers questions and offers very brief comments only when the professor calls on him/her. The comments and answers show lack of interest, improvisation and/or a poor preparation).
E: Lack of participation (the student does not answer questions and does not offer any comments in the class or group discussion. The lack of comments and answers or incorrect answers shows that the student has not completed the assignment or prepared for the class. If he/she has done it, it has been in a careless or incomplete way).

No attendance, no participation at all: When a student is not in class, he/she gets a 0 for that day.

Religious Observance: Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance conflicting with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

Disability: Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak to me and give me a copy of your accommodations form by the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Accessibility Services office may be consulted to discuss appropriate implementation of any accommodation request. If you do not have current authorization from SAS, contact that office at 646-9900 or blitz "Student Accessibility Services". If you have any difficulties with this course, please contact me at once and/or ask for support at the S.A.S. Office (Suite 205 Collis).

Honor code addendum: Students may not ask anyone other than the professor of their course to correct written work for this course. Students must rely on their judgment and conscience to determine whether a specific question might be addressed to a classmate or a friend (e.g. help with an idiom not readily available in a dictionary, or the conjugation of a rare irregular verb), but in any case, such aid must be minimal, occasional, and acknowledged. Outside proofreading/correcting changes the student's work, gives the professor an inaccurate idea of the student's skills, and as such violates the Dartmouth College honor principle. As a Dartmouth Student you are required to comply with the Academic Honor Principle: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~deancoll/documents/handbook/conduct/standards/honor.htm
Note: Not ALL the topics/pages in the book will be covered in class, and some concepts will be repeated.
