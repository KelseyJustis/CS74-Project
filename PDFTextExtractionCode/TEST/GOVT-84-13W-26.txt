DESCRIPTION:
Countries emerging from civil war face a unique set of challenges in creating the conditions for lasting peace and dealing with the trauma and devastation of war. This course examines three broad themes related to post-conflict societies: 1) the causes of conflict and the cessation of violence; 2) factors that affect the durability of peace; and 3) the longer-term prospects for reconciliation and justice in war-torn countries.
ASSIGNMENTS:
Discussion questions: You are required to email me 3-4 questions for class discussion by 9:00am on the day of each class meeting. We will be meeting 18 times this term, and you will be responsible for submitting questions for 14 of these sessions, excepting the two sessions when we will be watching films in class (Feb. 21 & 28) and two sessions of your choosing. Your questions should raise issues that you find to be particularly interesting, unclear, or otherwise noteworthy.
Reading and class participation: This seminar is reading-intensive. You will be expected to read all assigned materials before class and to participate actively in class discussions. You should plan to arrive in class prepared with comments, critiques, and questions related to the assigned readings for each session. All readings will be available through blackboard. There are also three required films (two of which we will watch in class) that will be made available through blackboard.
Response papers (three): You will be responsible for producing a written response to the assigned readings for class three times during the quarter. Each response paper should be about five double-spaced pages. Response papers should be submitted via email to me by 9:00am on day of the class session for which you are writing. At the top of each paper, in addition to your name, please indicate the date of the class. Note that you may not produce more than one response paper in any given week.
Papers should engage key debates in the readings, provide your thoughts and reactions to them, and raise questions for further inquiry. There is no one correct format for response papers. They must be coherent, but otherwise, form and content are up to you. You may use the papers to raise questions about the readings that you think warrant discussion or further clarification;
1

identify and discuss claims advanced by the readings with which you disagree, or toward which you are skeptical; highlight points of agreement or disagreement across more than one of the
readings assigned for that day, or across readings for that day and those earlier on the syllabus; and address other themes, as you see fit. While you should read all items for the class session before writing your papers, you should not feel compelled to try to summarize all readings or to
be comprehensive in your coverage. You are encouraged to focus on key ideas and debates that strike you as particularly important and interesting.

Research paper: You will produce a substantial paper on the topic of your choosing (15-20 pages double-spaced). A short research proposal (about 2 pages) describing your proposed topic will be due by midnight
on January 28. All students will meet with me at some point in the term to discuss their topics.

CLASS POLICIES:
The Honor Principle. All students are reminded of their obligation to conduct themselves in accordance with the Standards of Conduct in general and with the Academic Honor Principle in particular. The Academic Honor Principle is available at www.dartmouth.edu/~uja/honor/. Please review the section on plagiarism in particular and contact me if you have any questions.
X-Hours. While I have not scheduled any meetings during x-hours, I reserve the option to do so if we need extra time to cover the material on the syllabus. Students should therefore not schedule other obligations that conflict with the x-hour for this course.
Late papers will be penalized one-third grade per day. If you anticipate that you will have a problem meeting a deadline due to an excusable issue (e.g., family emergency, grave illness, etc.) contact me before the assignment is due to make appropriate arrangements.
Disabilities. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact me before the end of the second week of the term to arrange appropriate accommodations.
Religious Observance. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please contact me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
Office Hours. I will be available during the times noted on the first page for meetings with students. If you are unable to meet during these times, please email me to set up an appointment at an alternative time.
