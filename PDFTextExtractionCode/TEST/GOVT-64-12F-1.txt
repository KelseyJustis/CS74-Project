Course Description
Liberal political theory is renowned for its emphasis on rights, freedoms, and limited government; but critics of liberalism hold that the liberal legacy in free societies is one of misguided energies and broken promises. Students in this course chart the development of liberal thought from the Seventeenth Century to the present, with a view to considering the central values and commitments liberals may share, and examining important contemporary work in liberal theory. The course integrates weighty challenges to the moral and political viability of liberalism from communitarian, conservative, libertarian, postmodern, and value-pluralist critics.
We will reckon with a panoply of questions, including the following: Does liberalism overemphasize the importance of the individual at the expense of community? Are liberal societies bound to be licentious, selfish, and atomized? Do liberal theories rest upon a mistaken view of the self and its construction? Are liberal theories committed to the excessive promotion of autonomy for persons, or are they unfair to religion? Should we understand liberalism to be based merely in the pursuit of modus vivendi, or might there be some shared vision of a moral life on which liberals can base their theories?

Each of these texts has been ordered and should be available for purchase at Wheelock Books.

A complete listing of the items placed on reserve for Govt. 64.01 is given at the end of the syllabus.

Format
Govt. 64.01 is not simply a lecture course, since lectures will be joined by in-class discussion in which you are invited to participate. Normally, there will be a period of lecturing at the outset of each class, following which the floor will be opened to discussion. Classes will focus on specific readings (described below in the course schedule), with different works examined in each successive week. There is a good deal of involved reading in the course, but it is crucial that you come prepared so that you can make use of the lectures and the discussions with your cohort. Please also bring the books and your other readings with you, when we discuss them, since we will frequently refer to passages in the texts. If there are changes to be made to the syllabus, or adjustments of other kinds, they will be announced in class.

Grading

Students' grades will be comprised of the following four components:

1. Sixty-minute exam 2. Seven-page paper 3. Final exam 4. Class participation
