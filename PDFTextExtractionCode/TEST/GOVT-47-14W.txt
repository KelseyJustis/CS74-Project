Dartmouth College Winter Term 2014
Government 47: The Arab-Israeli Conflict
Prof. Sa'adah
For the better part of a century, the conflict over Palestine has defied resolution. This course examines the several dimensions and levels (domestic, international) of the ongoing crisis in, around, and about Israel/Palestine. In what ways is the conflict central to broader political patterns in the region, and why has it proven so intractable? What possibilities does the future hold? The tensions and instability generated by the ArabIsraeli conflict have profoundly affected--and been affected by--both international politics and the domestic politics of a wide range of countries. We will pay particular attention to the complex causal connections between the conflict and other regional issues, including economic and political underdevelopment, hegemonic projects, authoritarianism, political instability, and fundamentalism. We will try to understand how the various parties to the conflict have defined its stakes, understood their interests, viewed their adversaries, mobilized support, and formulated policy. We will consider grassroots politics as well as elite calculations. We will examine the role played by ideas, institutions, material interests, and leadership, at both the regional and the broader international levels. We will begin and end by assessing the prospects for a settlement.
Goals and Requirements
Conflicts in and about the Middle East test liberal education in two ways. A liberal education promotes both empathetic understanding (the ability to put oneself in someone else's place and understand his or her point of view, to grasp the sensibility and logic of a different culture, to feel the immediacy of another age) and analytical understanding (the ability to place oneself outside a situation or argument, to analyze it according to external criteria and rules, and to communicate the analysis effectively). Both kinds of understanding are often in short supply in discussions of the Middle East--as they also are in the region itself. Both require hard work. The most obvious goal of this course is to introduce students to the main actors and phases of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and to help students understand the conflict's dynamics and the reasons why a settlement has not yet been achieved. But the more important and more general goal is to encourage empathetic and analytical habits and skills.
Government 47 will meet in the 12 slot (including, whenever necessary or advantageous, the x-hour: Tuesday, 1:00-1:50). Lectures and discussion will complement the readings. Written requirements will include a take-home midterm examination due at the beginning of class on Jan. 31 (about 30% of the final grade), an 8- to 10-page paper (40% of the final grade) due at the beginning of class on Feb. 28, and a take-home cumulative final examination due by 9:30 a.m. on March 10 (30% of the final grade). The examinations will test command of material covered in lectures as well as in the reading. If you miss a

class, you are still responsible for the material covered, and you should not expect to get a summary from me. There will be no individual extensions on the due dates for written work.
The core readings for the class are listed on the syllabus below. Class announcements, "handouts" (including study questions), and additional readings (including primary source documents) will be posted on the course's Blackboard site. Unless clearly marked otherwise, all material posted on the course's Blackboard site should be considered required reading.
All students are reminded of their obligation to conduct themselves in accordance with the Standards of Conduct in general and with the Academic Honor Principle in particular. Any student who fails to complete any of the written assignments on time or who violates the Honor Principle should expect to fail the course.
If you have any special circumstances relevant to your academic performance, please come see me during the first week of the term.
My office is in Silsby 217. I can always be reached by email. Please check the Blackboard site for up-to-date information about office hours.
Organization of the Course
One way to understand the Arab-Israeli conflict is to view it as a complex struggle among communities in search of their own identities and political structures, in a setting deeply influenced by Great Power interests and rivalries. During the first weeks of the course, we will cover some of the conceptual material and historical background necessary to spell out and assess this (or any other) understanding of the conflict.
The rest of the course follows the chronology of the struggle, which has been punctuated by three watershed moments: the 1948 War, which resulted in the creation of the state of Israel; the 1967 War, during which Israel occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights; and the First Intifada, which highlighted the problematic aspects of the occupation but failed to produce a settlement. As we examine different facets of the conflict, we will superimpose other relevant chronologies--e.g. of the Cold War, of partisan shifts in Israeli politics, of the internal development, external relations, and eventual decline of the PLO, and of the emergence of new forms of political activism among both Israelis and Palestinians.
The reading list is likely to strike you as...long. Please do not be discouraged by this observation. The list is long in part because the conflict is both extremely interesting (prompting reflection on many of the most central issues in political science) and devilishly complicated. It is also long in part because I hope to help you improve how you cope with complex arguments and masses of information. You will draw on this skill for the rest of your life. We will have a conversation about how to approach the reading in the x-hour during the second week of classes. And just so you don't have to

ask: no, you do not have to read every word of Tessler's enormous book. You do, however, have to know which words to read!
Different subfields within political science offer provide students with different intellectual toolboxes. This course draws heavily on the toolboxes commonly associated with the subfields of comparative politics (politics within states) and international relations (politics between states: war and trade). Please consciously look for and utilize appropriate intellectual tools as you try to understand the conflict.
Social science, however good, will never give you anything approximating full insight into the logic of another society--much less into its passions, conflicts, and aspirations. If you enjoy literature and film, this is good news. Two films are assigned, others are streamed, and many more are available. Important literary works have been translated, and so are accessible to everyone. I will distribute a list of relevant works during the first weeks of class.
