Professor Kyle Smith

Class: 10-11:50 Tu & Thurs Office hours: by appointment Contact: 603-646-1486; kyle.s.smith@dartmouth.edu; 266 Moore Hall

This course will focus on brain mechanisms of reward. We will cover old and new ideas about pleaure in the brain, but mainly will dicuss advances in neuroscience research on various aspects of pleasure. We might even learn about general principles of brain function in the process. Course material will be posted on Canvas, and is subject to modification hroughout the semester. Our goal is not only to learn about the curent status of the field, but also to gain strength in core elements of science inquiry: reading primary literature, digesting it, thinking about it critically (even if you don't understand it all), and presenting about it cogently.

X-hours: As of now they are unschedued, but they may be used as we progress through the course (Wed 3-3:50).

Course Structure and Assignments:
Participation: The class is run as sort of a "journal club" with a big emphasis on discussion. So, attendance and participation is critical (and a part of your grade). You will be called on to give your opinions and thoughts online as well as in class. There are no bad comments or questions, even basic ones about the brain.
Reading. We will be reading published peer-reviewed articles or book chapters. Reading before class is essential to a successful course experience. Every student is expected to read (1) the assigned regular articles, and (2) one extra reading of your choice from the list of reviews or experiment articles prior to that class. Additional readings apply for the presentation-paper and depth paper. The reading list and electronic PDFs or links will be posted on Canvas.
Online journal entries. Everyone will contribute online comments (half-page) to the Canvas discussion board before each class, including classes in which students present material (due by midnight the night before; double-length if deadline missed). For these, you are asked to write your observations, opinions, and thoughts about a class topic and reading. These should be formally written and should relate directly to the reading material. But the content can vary greatly depending on what piques your interest and can flow in a stream-of-consciousness way (sort of like a blog entry). Each commentary should include two questions pertaining to the material for potential discussion in the class. The first one is due before January 9 (topic: the limbic system material).

Presentation-paper. Everyone will be assigned one class day/topic to present to the class. For this, you will read the required articles and two additional readings. You will select one of the listed experiment readings (or another, with my permission) and present it to the class. Presentations will be about 20 min, and will include background (from required readings and the selected article), methods, results, and implications. We will then open the class up for discussion. I will present an article on the limbic system topic to provide an example. Powerpoint is not necessary, but advisable (for graphs, pictures, videos, etc). It is recommended you practice with a friend to help develop your presentation. In addition, a paper on this topic will be due within 1 week of the presentation (5-7 typed pages, 1.5-2 spacing, 11pt Ariel or Times font). For this, you will write a summary of the material and insert some independnet thoughts/comments/ideas (see writing tips below).
Depth paper. Everyone will complete a depth paper (8-12 pages) on the topic below using at least 5 readings from the course; finding additional readings is encouraged. Depth papers are due March 4 at noon. An outline, either in writing or in conversation, will be due to me during the week of Feb 3 (at the latest) so I can make sure you are on the right track for developing and organizing your ideas. I am happy to provide advice and additional material. It is encouraged that each person keeps a bibliography of the readings they've done (the citation plus a short summary); these will be useful to you when writing later.
Depth question: You are a neuroscientist and have any tool you want at your fingertips: fMRI, stimulation and recording electrodes, lesions, optogenetics, viruses & CLARITY anatomical tools, and drugs. It is possible for you to stimulate/inhibit/record any type of neuron or brain pathway, in any species, for any type of reward. Design one ore more studies to evaluate brain mechanisms of reward based on what we've learned in the course. Make sure experiments contain proper controls. Consder procedures to help you interpret effects as related to pleasure versus motivation, learning, expectation, etc. Paper organization: background, research question(s), methods, potential results, interpretations and implications. Only a rough sketch of methods is needed, but it should be clear that you understand the basics of the techniques, what you propose to do with them, what you will measure, and how you will interpret possible results. Potential research questions could include deciphering how brain reward centers work, figuring out brain reward anatomy (i.e. defining the limbic system), understanding or treating addiction or anhedonia, resolving how different kinds of rewards are represented in the brain, understanding how an experience can made to be rewarding or not depending on your state (e.g., satiety vs. hunger), understanding sexual preference, investigating reward centers across species, or any unresolved question on the topics covered in class or raised in the readings.

*Late journal entry: accepted for 24 more hours, but double length required. **Late papers: accepted, but one letter grade lower for each 24 hr period it is late. ***Late presentations: not possible.

Notes on writing and plagiarism:
Quick plagiarism note: Don't do it! The brain is pretty good at pattern detection, so it is usually evident when material is copied or when sections of a paper diverge from the student's style.
Longer plagiarism note: It is not easy not to do it! Writing about scientific publications without just rephrasing is difficult, particularly when not everything is fully understood. Doing this properly takes time and practice, and one goal of the course is to move us in that direction. I don't expect to see a perfect scientific treatment at this stage. But I do want to see evidence of independent thought, of considering the material and implications (rather than just regurgitating it), and of some creativity in putting this together. When quoting, be sure appropriate citations are made.

Writing tips: (1) get a big picture or idea in your mind from the reading, and then write with paragraphs tackling sub-themes, as we all learned to do (topic sentence, etc.). (2) It can work well to interleave your own thoughts and experiences, or to reference to material not on the reading list even from other disciplines, or to take question the validity of the results and interpretations (e.g., if experiments were well-controlled, or if gaps are missing in arguments; don't worry whether I would agree). I don't care if you use the first person. (3) Consider incorporating thoughts on future experiments, whether directly feeding off of the work or applied to other species or conditions; likewise, general ideas to test in some way in the future. (4) Quoting the material can work if done in moderation, but the majority of it must be your own writing. (5) Always feel free to get feedback prior to deadlines.
Some thought questions for writing if you are stuck: What might be some additional useful experiments or comparisons? Does this give you insight into your own experiences? What kind of reward might you experience on occasions, and how could you test that? In the case of a patient or experimental preparation, what are some other tests or questions that you would like to address? What are the limitations to the experimental approach or concept, and how might they be improved? Are there other types of experience that might be rewarding? How might they be studied? If there were dysfunction (hyper or hopoactivity) in these systems, what might happen to a person? What are your ethical limitations for experiments and treatments of disorders as our knowledge of reward evolves? Although we are focusing on biological mechanism here, there are other factors that might be considered for reward as well (evoluationary, developmental, societal, cross-species comparisons, etc.).
