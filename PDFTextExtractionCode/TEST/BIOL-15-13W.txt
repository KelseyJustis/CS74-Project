Course Description
In this course students will be introduced to the major evolutionary processes that occur on a population level. We will concentrate on the mechanisms of evolutionary
change and how they are modeled using practices from population and quantitative genetics. We will also consider the nature and limits of various forms of selection,
problems of classification and phylogenetic inference, as well as the roles of random drift in molecular evolution. Through in-class discussions and problem-solving
sessions, students will explore dynamics of various natural populations, including variation within human population and its implications to heritable and infectious
diseases.

Students are expected to (1) carefully read the assigned material before class, (2) enthusiastically participate in class discussions and problem-solving sessions, and (3)
diligently prepare for all exams and labs.

Every class period will start with ~ 20-30 min. of lecture that would summarize the most important concepts of the topic. For the remainder of the class, the students will work in
assigned small groups on problems, which will be handed out. Some of the problems will involve using web-based tools, therefore the students are required to bring their
laptops to each class period.

Teaching Assistants: Jessica Trout-Haney
Beth Reinke Christine Urbanowicz

Laboratories: Laboratory Coordinator: Craig Layne
We will be offering laboratory sections on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday afternoons, 2-6pm, 104 LSC. You can sign up for lab sections on the first day of class, January 7th.

The Social Contract at Dartmouth: When you decided to attend Dartmouth, you agreed to join an academic
community and to dedicate yourself to the "pursuit of intellectual and personal growth." In doing so you agreed to follow the Standards of Conduct described in the Student
Handbook. One of these standards is that you must not "intentionally disrupt, interfere with, or obstruct teaching." I interpret this standard to mean that it is your responsibility
not to deliberately interfere with the learning of any Dartmouth student. Because cellphone and laptop use have the potential to interrupt teaching and learning in this
classroom, I have set the following policies: Cell Phones: Cell phone use during class is not allowed. Please be sure all cell
phones are turned off or disabled before class starts. Laptops: You are expected to use portable computing devices of any sort to
directly further your education in this course. Please refrain from checking email, browsing the internet, visiting chat rooms, and anything else that is not directly relevant
to this course. While you may be willing to accept the consequences of giving less than your full attention to a class meeting, your computer screen is not private in this
classroom and can distract other students who do want to fully engage with this course. Academic Honor: The Dartmouth Honor Principle
(http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/acad-honor.html) applies to all work you submit for a grade in this course. That is, the lab reports you turn in must be
your own unless the assignment has been explicitly identified as a group activity by the

3

professor. All computer output that that you turn in should be created, typed, documented, and generated by you. In lab, you may consult freely with others while designing analyses, running analyses, and drawing conclusions, but you should generate your own output, including the write-up, and answer laboratory's questions on your own. Any copying of another person's lab report, in whole or in part, is a violation of the Honor Principle.
Student Needs: Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see me before the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Accessibility Services office may be consulted to discuss appropriate implementation of any accommodation requested.
