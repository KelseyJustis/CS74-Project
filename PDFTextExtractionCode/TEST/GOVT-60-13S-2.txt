Government 60.02 Spring 2013
Immigration law, Asylum and Politics.
Professor Carol Bohmer Office: 224 Silsby Hall (6-3469) Class hours: M/W/F 10-11.15 am (and all X hours Th 12-1pm). Office Hours: Mon 9-10 a.m., Th 1-2 pm, or by appointment.
Course Description This course examines the topic of immigration and asylum from a political, social, legal, economic and public policy perspective. As a nation of immigrants, much of our self-identity is bound up in the idea that we are forever the "unfinished" nation. What does this mean? How are our views and policies on immigration different from those of other nations with different identities and histories? How do other nations deal with immigration? What has been the effect of increasing globalization on immigration? How do we address the problems of security and the need (both in law and philosophy) to provide a safe haven to those who seek asylum from persecution elsewhere?
Course Requirements This is a course in which class discussion will be emphasized. Accordingly, you are expected to read all the assigned materials, and to come to class prepared to discuss them. If students do not seem to be doing the required reading, there will be pop quizzes to check that the reading has been done. Students might want to begin reading the novel assigned early in the quarter, especially given the fact that it is to be discussed when the exam is handed back.
Assignments 1) Each student will write his/her immigration autobiography, going back at least two generations. After a short description, address one of the following questions: 1) Which part of your history is most important for your identity and why? 2) What part of your background was NOT mentioned and why? Length: Approx. 4-6 pages. It will be handed in on April 1. Students will be required to describe the main points in class (15% of grade). 2) A midterm exam which will be a take home exam. Students will receive the exam on April 18 and it will be due on April 25 (30% of grade). Length 7-10 pages. 3) Final research paper: Students may select their own topics for the research paper, but they must be approved by me. Topics relating to the issues covered in the course or any other area of immigration are likely to be approved. Students who select areas covered in class are expected to take their subject beyond class materials and/or to present an analysis from a different perspective from that discussed in the course (for example, a comparative or historical perspective). Students who need assistance in the selection or focus of a topic should see me. Each student must present a written outline and brief bibliography of the proposed topic by April 15 (Failure to do so or to change topics without handing in a revised outline will result in a lowered grade). The research paper (between 10-15 pages) must be handed in on May 29 (40% of grade).
