Course Overview:
Course Vision: "Healthy Students Contributing to Healthy Communities"
Course Purpose: The purpose of this course is to enhance Dartmouth undergraduates' awareness, knowledge and experiences and to foster skills and commitment to improving health, particularly the health of themselves and that of the members of the Upper Valley Community. We aim to increase awareness, foster personal commitment, and propose solutions to public health challenges through a collaborative community-based approach. The course will use an experiential and collaborative community-based approach to apply the principles of public health, determinants of health, behavior change, and systems improvement. In addition, the course will promote a shared vision and establish a learning environment from which collaborative interventions can occur among Dartmouth undergraduates, graduate school professionals, faculty, physicians and community members, leaders, and organizations. Course Principles: It takes a community to improve health. Awareness promotes action and action brings about change. It is therefore critical for college students to be aware of their own health and that of the community within which they live. Many Dartmouth students have little to no exposure to public health issues or to the Upper Valley beyond Hanover. Health is impacted by numerous determinants including environmental, socioeconomic, and political factors. Individual behavioral change combined with systems based improvement can advance health at the individual and the societal level. This active engagement of students in partnerships with public health professionals will foster sustainable change. Course Values & Commitments I Value and Commit to:
1. Health; My Health and the Health of Others 2. Personal Behavior that fosters respect, innovation and individual growth and
relationships 3. Teams that support diverse discussion, set clear expectations and hold members
accountable 4. A Learning Environment that is engaging, supportive, safe and sustainable 5. Feedback that is timely, constructive, continuous and promotes positive change Course Organization and Faculty: This course will be directed and overseen by Professor Catherine Pipas, MD, MPH. A multidisciplinary curriculum advisory committee (CAC) will advise on the development and implementation of the course. Speakers and members of the CAC will include, but not be limited to, Dartmouth students, Geisel School of Medicine faculty, The Dartmouth Institute
4

for Health Policy & Clinical Practice faculty, Dartmouth College social science professors, and representatives from local organizations. Content expert speakers will contribute to sessions appropriate to his/her research and specialty. Speakers will be chosen based on knowledge and expertise in a specific area of Public Health. On site learning will occur during site visits to community organizations during class period and/or during teamarranged time. Course enrollment is capped at 16 students. (4 groups of 4)
