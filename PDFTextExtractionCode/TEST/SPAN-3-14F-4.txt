Spanish 3
Course Description
Spanish 3 (Intermediate Spanish II) is the culminating course of the Spanish language sequence. Throughout the term we will continue the study of the various cultures of Spanish-speaking peoples, the study of grammar and syntax, and the practice of spoken and written Spanish. The course will be conducted entirely in Spanish.
Course Objectives
By the end of the term students should be able to:
· Gain a further understanding of cultural practices and perspectives of Spanishspeaking peoples.
· Speak and understand Spanish with enough fluency (Intermediate ­Mid on the ACTFL scale) to participate in most informal and some formal conversations regarding a variety of topics.
· Read in Spanish accurately enough to understand a variety of written texts from both a linguistic and interpretive perspective.
· Write in Spanish appropriately and effectively (Intermediate-Mid on the ACTFL scale) in both narrative and argumentative styles.
As a student in this course, you may have to review on your own grammar topics not covered in this course. Your textbook will be a helpful resource. In addition, there are other online resources listed on our department web site at http://www.dartmouth.edu/~spanport/resources/.
*** If you are considering participating in an LSA program, you should not take this course on campus, as it is part of the LSA program. ***

GENERAL INFORMATION
· Attendance: Classes are held 4 days a week; drills meet 3 days a week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays). Attendance to all class and drill sessions is mandatory. Every absence after two (class and drill combined) will lower your Final Grade. Three tardies are equal to one full absence. If you miss class, you are responsible for finding out what went on, including announcements, changes to the syllabus, and assignments. Athletes in season should meet with their professors after class on the first day of classes to review expectations and class attendance.
· Class Preparation: Students should thoroughly prepare for each day's class by studying all material indicated on the syllabus for that day BEFORE coming to class as any of it may serve as a discussion topic or be present in quizzes. Only workbook exercises completed and submitted online by the stipulated dates and times will receive chapter assignment credit.
· Drills: Drill sessions are scheduled at 7:45am, 1:45pm. Each student will register at the beginning of the term for one of these sessions and attend that session on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday throughout the term.
· Class / Drill Participation: In addition to attendance to and preparation for all classes, your willingness to contribute, your personal effort and progress are taken into consideration in the participation grade. See below, *Notes on Participation. Efforts to communicate with classmates respectfully and meaningfully in Spanish and to listen carefully to fellow students are of utmost importance. There may be random testing of the material assigned for the day that will also be part of your grade. No gum, no eating during class, no hats.
· LSA/FSP: Any student who wishes to interview other Dartmouth student about his/hers experience in an abroad program, and who submits a commentary regarding his/her experience, will be able to substitute one missed drill session with that activity. Please contact your professor for approval. Not applicable during the last week of the term!
· Workbooks: All of the self-corrected electronic workbook exercises are to be completed and submitted online by 11:59 p.m. on the date due, as specified in syllabus, in order to receive credit.
· Compositions: Compositions will be written in class. The topics will be provided the day of the composition.
· Video materials: Students will view the movie Nueve Reinas. Discussion of the movie will take place in class, and the themes will be incorporated into composition topics and exam questions.
· Reading materials: Students will read a short detective novel beginning the second week of classes. Discussion of the novel will take place in class, and the themes will be incorporated into composition topics and exam questions.

· Oral interviews: Each student will participate in a debate (in pairs) at the end of the term. The students will prepare several topics, which will be posted on Canvas. On the day of the interview, students will choose a topic without knowing which one it is, and develop the debate. It should last 6 minutes and each of the students should participate equally.
· Written Exams: There will be two scheduled exams and a final exam. Exams will be hand-written in class in INK. No student will be allowed to take an exam on a date other than that scheduled without a letter from a physician or a coach. No postponements of any exams. The Final Exam must be taken on the scheduled date.
· Final Grade: Your final grade will be determined as follows:
Class Participation ............................. 25%
(Attendance, drill and workbook exercises)
Exams .............................................. 30%

Compositions ..................................... 10%

Oral Exam ......................................... Final Exam ........................................

Notes on Class participation: Students are expected to come to class having prepared ALL materials assigned. In class, students must participate actively speaking in group activities and class discussions. Missing class lowers the participation grade.

Active Participation in class will be graded as follows:

A: Excellent participation (the student answers questions and offers interesting comments without the need of the professor calling on him/her. The comments and answers show that the student is well prepared, completed and understood the assignment).
B: Good participation (the student answers questions and offers interesting comments whenever the professor calls on him/her. Sometimes, the student participates without being asked. The comments and answers show that the student is prepared and understood the assignment).

C: Fair participation (the student answers questions and offers comments only when the professor calls on him/her. The comments and answers show that the student prepared or attempted to complete the assignment, but doesn't seem to understand it all).
D: Poor participation (the student answers questions and offers very brief comments only when the professor calls on him/her. The comments and answers show lack of interest, improvisation and/or a poor preparation).
E: Lack of participation (the student does not answer questions and does not offer any comments in the class or group discussion. The lack of comments and answers or incorrect answers shows that the student has not completed the assignment or prepared for the class. If he/she has done it, it has been in a careless or incomplete way). No attendance, no participation at all: When a student is not in class, he/she gets a 0 for that day.
Religious Observance: Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance conflicting with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
Disability: Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak to me and give me a copy of your accommodations form by the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Accessibility Services office may be consulted to discuss appropriate implementation of any accommodation request. If you do not have current authorization from SAS, contact that office at 646-9900 or blitz "Student Accessibility Services". If you have any difficulties with this course, please contact me at once and/or ask for support at the S.A.S. Office (Suite 205 Collis).
Honor code addendum: Students may not ask anyone other than the professor of their course to correct written work for this course. Students must rely on their judgment and conscience to determine whether a specific question might be addressed to a classmate or a friend (e.g. help with an idiom not readily available in a dictionary, or the conjugation of a rare irregular verb), but in any case, such aid must be minimal, occasional, and acknowledged. Outside proofreading/correcting changes the student's work, gives the professor an inaccurate idea of the student's skills, and as such violates the Dartmouth College honor principle. As a Dartmouth Student you are required to comply with the Academic Honor Principle: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~deancoll/documents/handbook/conduct/standards/hono r.htm
Note: Not ALL the topics/pages in the book will be covered in class, and some concepts will be repeated.
