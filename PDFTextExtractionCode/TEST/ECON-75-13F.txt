Economics 75 Syllabus

DARTMOUTH COLLEGE Department of Economics

Professor Mansur Fall 2013

Environmental and Energy Economics

This course examines environmental and energy issues from an intermediate microeconomics perspective. The course begins by discussing fundamental concepts in environment economics including cost-benefit analysis and economic valuation of the environment. We also explore issues of policy design from an efficiency perspective. The class is introduced to issues of energy economics, including oil, natural gas, and electricity markets, and policies regarding renewables, transportation, and climate change. In examining the electricity industry, students will play a competitive strategy game representing firms in an electricity market.

This course is designed for economics majors and others interested in a quantitative and theoretical economics approach to environmental policy. As such, introductory economics and calculus are prerequisites. Intermediate microeconomics is suggested, though not required. While the course discusses some policy issues, it will focus on theoretical developments in the area of environmental and energy economics.

PRE-REQUISITES: Econ 1, Math 3.

Class participation and discussion: I evaluate discussion based on both quantity and quality of cold-called and voluntary responses in class. Before each class, I expect students to read the material. For half of the classes, email the professor one question the night before class based on the readings in order to facilitate discussion.
Games: Students play strategy games to learn about the oil and electricity industries. The students develop their own bidding strategies and write a group memo describing their team's strategy for each game. Grades are based on the memo and the group performance, i.e. profits.
Exams: are to be taken as scheduled, except in case of illness or family emergency. Students may bring one letter-sized sheet of paper with notes on both sides.

DISABILITIES: Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak to me and give me a copy of your accommodations form by the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Director of Student Disabilities may be consulted if questions arise.

RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES: Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
