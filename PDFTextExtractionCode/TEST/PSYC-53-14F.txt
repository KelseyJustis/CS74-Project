Course Description
Imagine having the ability to transmit your thoughts from your own brain to your friend's brain by sending them through the air as encoded signals. It sounds like science fiction if you put that way, but this is precisely what language allows us to do everyday all day long. In this course we will study the science of language ­ including topics ranging from the philosophical foundations of symbolic thought and meaning, to how children learn language, to language comprehension and production, to what we know about how the brain creates language. Assignments and evaluation will include short persuasive essays pertaining to selected readings from each topic area and two scheduled exams.
Required Reading
The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker, 1994 Morrow, NY
Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science by Matthew J. Traxler, 2012 Wiley-Blackwell
Coursework
Study Questions As incentive to keep up with the reading and spur class discussion, students are required to submit "Study Questions" for course credit. Each study question should be in the form of a short answer question ­ a question that can be answered in one paragraph. These must be original questions ­ questions copied from the text, other students, or other sources is plagiarism and a violation of the Academic Honor Principle. Questions must be accompanied by a short answer and a reference with page number to the reading it pertains to. Questions may be used as material for the mid-term and final exams. While students may submit as many questions as they like, only 10 questions (5 questions per half of the course) will count toward the final grade. In total each question along with its one-paragraph answer should not exceed 150 words.
1000 word essays Students should complete at least two essays (at least one per course half) on a chosen topic from the course material. Essays may not exceed 1000 words in length. The point of these essays is to engage students in critical thinking about the topics. The point of the short format is to be as concise and clear as possible. These are persuasive essays addressing a contentious scientific issue. Essays should compare and contrast at least two primary source scientific articles. They should have a thesis statement, and provide evidence in favor of one side or another of the issue at hand. Each essay is worth 15 points (see below).
Examinations There will be two scheduled examinations. One midterm and one final. Each will be worth 30 points. The first exam is mandatory, the second is optional (see below).

Grading Policy
Grading for the class is based on a 100 point scale. The maximum number of points earned cannot exceed 100. The class will be graded in two phases ­ one based on the first half of the class and the second based on the second half. Each half is worth 50 points.
Points may be earned for the first half of the course as follows:
No more than five points for Study Questions. Each study question handed in is worth one point.
No more than fifteen points for an essay.
No more than thirty points for the Midterm exam.
The three components of the first half of the course should be considered non-optional. You must hand in at least 5 study questions, one essay, and take the mid-term for full credit.
In contrast, the second half of the term is "Choose your own adventure":
No more than five points for Study Questions.
No more than Three essays where each essay is worth a maximum of 15 points each.
Optional Final Exam, worth 30 points.
For example, you could write three perfect essays for the second half of the term (hand in no Study Question, and skip the final) and still get 95 points for the course, assuming a perfect first half.
If a student does more than the minimum amount of work, then the combination resulting in the highest score will make the final grade. Note that this is only possible given two scenarios:
1) The student takes the Final Exam and writes 4 essays in total or 2) The student takes the Final exam and writes 3 essays in total. In the former case, either one exam, or a combination of two essays ­ whichever has the lowest combined grade ­ will be dropped. In the latter case, the essay with the lowest grade will be dropped.
Note: "Extra" exams or essays may not replace credits for Study Questions. Only the following substitutions are possible:
1. An extra essay may replace a grade for an essay with a lower score.
2. An exam with a score higher than the sum of two essays can replace those essays.
or
3. Two essays whose sum exceeds the score of one exam can replace the exam.
Grade Corrections: Grading should be fair. If a student receives a grade that is lower than it should be because of an ERROR on my part, that would be unfair. If the error is tangible and real, I will correct my mistake. However, I will not discuss grades with students in person. If a student believes that a grade was given in error, they must send me a letter, printed out on paper, explaining the error. (The purpose of the written letter is to avoid hasty exchanges by email.)
