Course Description: Health care systems are unique to the culture and history of each nation. However, all face similar challenges. This course examines health systems across developed and developing nations. Comparisons will be made in terms of: (a) population health, (b) health care organization, (c) health care financing, (d) health care providers, (e) treatment of HIV/AIDS, and (f) inequality in health.
The goals of the course are for students to:  develop an understanding of how health care is delivered around the world  learn the relative merits and limitations of various health care systems  identify the interconnections between health care systems in developed and developing countries  work with a team to produce an in-depth analysis of one country's health system  develop presentation skills, including development of slides and other materials, as well as public speaking skills  learn evaluation skills to provide constructive and critical feedback to others
This class is designed as a seminar in which much of the core content is delivered by student groups. You will work with a group of three students to analyze one country that you will present to the class at regular intervals (details about country reports are given below). It is essential that you come to class prepared to discuss the reading materials, and to learn about the countries analyzed by your peers. You will be required to evaluate group presentations, and to use the material presented by other groups in your short papers. Missing more than four class periods will result in failure of the course. Serious extenuating circumstances will be taken into consideration but must be discussed with me in advance. Please note that having a good reason to miss a class (e.g., job interview, illness) still "counts" as one of your four allowable absences.

In addition to country report presentations (40%) to the class there will be a series of short papers due throughout the term (60%).

Grades are determined, based on:

4 Country reports

10% each

4 Short papers

15% each

Honor Principle and work in this course: (1) Group projects. You will work with other students in your group, and can discuss your projects with other students/groups in the class. (2) Using and acknowledging ideas, formats, etc learned from other groups is strongly encouraged. (3) Short papers are independent work ONLY. I encourage you to discuss course materials with students from class and answer questions about your country if asked, but your paper is independent work. You are encouraged to have a friend or other person not related to the class read your paper and give you feedback.
