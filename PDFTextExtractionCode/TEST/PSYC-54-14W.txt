Course Description 

This course will explore the role of psychology and health.  We will review both 

empirical/research and clinical psychology contributions to: 1) health promotion 2) 

chronic physical illness and 3) interacting with the US healthcare system. This course 

utilizes a multimodal learning approach and will include lectures, readings, large and 

small group class discussions, videos, guest speakers, and selfreflection of  your own 

health behavior. Through indepth study of medical conditions such as diabetes, cystic 

fibrosis, cancer and chronic physical pain, we will explore the impact of illnesses on the 

individual/family, the role of development/cognitive factors in illness, 

adherence/selfmanagement issues, and medical treatment issues via doctor/ 

patient/medical system aspects of care. We will also review health promotion/behavior 

change strategies.

Grading System    LATE POLICY:  Papers not turned in by the start of class (Blitz mail time, i.e. what the  time is on blitzmail system) will be considered late.  Each 24 hour period they are late  they will lose 4 points, so if a paper is due at 4pm, 4 points off till 4pm the following day,  4 pts off the next 24 hours, etc.      1. Class/Xhour on ­time attendance/ inclass participation  20% final grade 
Class and Xhour attendance and participation are critical to learning the material of this  course.  Your participation helps you learn and it contributes to your fellow students'  learning.  Participation encompasses all forms of behavior in class, such as answering  questions, sharing your ideas, joining in group activities, leading/participating in small  groups, etc. Being late, leaving early and/or missing class suggests the class is not a  priority to you and will have a negative impact on your grade in this course.    Treat your class time as you would attendance at a job. Like a job, If you are ready to go  by the start of class, Blitzmail time, you are on time.  ***You get two total "arrive late,  OR, leave early, OR missed class passes this term *** to be used by you as you like  (though assignments due that daye still considered late if not turned in)..  After that,  whenever you a) miss and/or b) arrive late, and/or c) leave early you will lose points from  your attendance/participation grade for each occurrence.    What are "excused" reasons for missing Health Psychology class, and, what  documentation will I need to consider a miss excused?   
a) being sick in bed to be excused this will require verification from Dick's House  b) family death/ emergency  c) job/med/grad school interviews (please schedule to avoid missing class if 
possible, but if/when you have to miss,  I need a copy of official confirmation  letter)  d) conference attendance/presentation (need confirmation from your professor)  e) 1 "away" varsity athletic "leave early/missed class" with confirmation from coach    To help you all get as good a class participation grade as possible....given past  experience with laptops in this course...they get in the way of learning, as opposed to  help learning and contribute to you as a student being somewhere else, mentally.....  So given that....    ***Laptop Computers **will not be allowed during class time except 1) doing  quizzes 2) checking blitz etc before class, during class breaks, and 3)  during the  research strategy session and 4) when presenting your 5 powerpoint slides during  your 5 min research paper presentation Feb 13th.  The same goes for cell phones,  IPads and other tablets or any other electronics. Use them before and after class, or  during break, only please.

Format: You will have five quizzes and a final for this course. These will cover any

have a case/synthesis/integration focus.  . The final exam for the 3A time slot for W14 

is March 13 11:30am2:30pm. Given our 3A final exam time period is typically the last 

possible final exam time slot, the exam will be offered remotely (e.g. you can take it from 

your dorm room, library, or if you choose to, from home). You will email me your final, 

however if you choose to do so.....It is your responsibility to have the technological 

aspects of completing this task. If you are not on campus you should have a backup 

plan to a problematic email connection to fax the final to the psychology dept fax ( 603 

6461419). Note that Finals not turned in by 3:00pm Eastern Standard Blitz mail 

Time on March 13h will be considered late.

behaviors for specific time periods during the term. This will be done on Blackboard and 

"spot checked" by me throughout the term.  Details about this assignment will be 

forthcoming.  You will turn in a final hardcopy journal on the last day of class Thursday 

March 6th. 

 

5. Research Paper

20% of final grade 

For this assignment, you are to choose a topic related to the course on which you will 

write a 5page, typewritten, double spaced research paper.  You will need to use 

peerreviewed journal articles and other scholarly materials for your paper. Late papers 

will be graded as described previously.   

  

You must address a hypothesis or answer a question regarding health psychology in your 

research paper.  Your grade will incorporate the timeliness(e.g. using recent research) 

and quality of your hypothesis and your outline. The paper will be 5 pages, typewritten, 

doublespaced, 1inch margins, in APA format.  A brief 5slide PowerPoint presentation 

of your findings will be part of what you turn in with your final paper and present in 

small groups on Thursday Nov 8th and you will present your papers  on small groups to 

each other that day..
