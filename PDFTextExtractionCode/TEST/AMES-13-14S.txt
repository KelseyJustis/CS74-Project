Class Description Japanese cultural history through a broad survey of literature, art, social and political institutions, and popular culture. Modern conceptions of Japan and formations of Japanese identity have evolved under the pressures created by radical swings between periods of wholesale appropriation of foreign cultural forms and periods of extreme isolation. The course will trace the evolution of Japanese culture by examining the ways in which cultural archetypes are distinguished in Japan. Taught in English. Open to all classes. Required for the LSA+, major and minor. Dist: LIT; WCult: CI.

Learning Objectives
By the end of the class students should have acquired the following: · a general understanding of the entire sweep of Japanese cultural history, including the political, social, and cultural characteristics of each epoch · a familiarity with some of the major canonical works of the Japanese literary tradition, and an ability to interpret and explicate them in keeping with their historical and cultural context · a knowledge of some of the general paradigms of literary theory and cultural studies, and the capability of applying those theories to texts

Teaching Methods & Expectations for Students Japanese 10 / AMES 13 is an introductory level course and often with a large enrollment. These factors largely determine the way the course is taught. The texts are of, essentially, three types, and you should prepare them in different ways:
· Japanese history (Walthall, Japan: A Cultural, Social And Political History). Read the chapters before class and make note of the major trends. I will lecture on history, expanding and highlighting on the material in the textbook.
· Literary (and filmic) texts. For each one you should identify a scene or element that is the most important. This assignment is intentionally vague, and intended to make room for a wide range of approaches. At times I will provide a short list of questions to guide your reading. Come to class prepared to 1) identify an important passage by page number (or time for films), so that the entire class may reference it, 2) to paraphrase it in the context of the work as a whole, and 3) to state briefly why it is crucial to understanding the text or film as a whole. Students are expected

to prepare every literary or filmic text in this way. Be sure to have these texts with you in class, in either hard or digital copy.
· Theory. The syllabus includes a number of essays unrelated to Japan but integral to the fields of literary and cultural analysis. In preparing this material students should again pick the most important passage or idea, and be ready to both identify it by page number and summarize it in your own words. The best way to get the knack of working with theory is to re-phrase the points with vocabulary or examples that make sense to you. Students are expected to do this for every theoretical work we examine. Be sure to have these texts with you in class, in either hard or digital copy.
I will invite student comments on the readings and I will also call on students for input of this sort. I realize that perfect preparation is not possible on all days; if you're not prepared to comment, simply say, "I'd like to pass today." But don't play that card too often. One last note: I realize that the foreign place and people names are difficult to remember. I will do my best to minimize this burden, but in many cases there is simply no way around it.

Religious Observances Policy Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations

Student Needs
Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations
is requested to speak to me by the end of the second week of the term at the very latest. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Disabilities Coordinator may be consulted to verify the documentation of the disability. Accommodating students with unique
needs is a priority for me, but I can only act on that if I have the necessary information.

Academic Honor In the context of this class, the honor code is understood to mean that all work turned in for grading is to be the student's own. All intellectual debts are to be acknowledged by means of proper citation. See the instructor if clarification is desired.

Course Schedule (*Note: professional responsibilities will take me out of town on two Fridays: 28 March and 18 April. The first of these will be made up during x-hour on 8 April. The second is an in-class exam and I will arrange for somebody to proctor it in my place.*)
