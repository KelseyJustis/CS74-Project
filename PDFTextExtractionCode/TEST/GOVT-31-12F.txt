Description: Do campaigns matter?  If yes, how?  Does knowing how they matter mean victory on Election 

Day?  This course will seek to answer these questions from both the academic and the practical perspectives.  

Among other things, it will investigate the effectiveness of campaigns, the behavior of voters, candidates' 

strategies, media relations and possible election reforms.  Beyond an understanding of both academic and 

practical theories of political campaigns, students should leave this class very knowledgeable about recent 

and contemporary campaigns and elections.  

Texts: There are 8 required books for the class.
