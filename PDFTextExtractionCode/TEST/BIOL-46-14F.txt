Lab Instructor: Nicholas Sylvain Graduate Teaching Assistants:

Alan Collins Gary Heussler

The required text for the course is "Brock: Biology of Microorganisms", 14th Edition, by Madigan, Martinko, Bender, Buckley and Stahl. There is one copy on reserve at Dana Library.

Grading in the course will be based on:

2 Midterms Final
Lab

40% (each worth 20%) 25%
35%

You are also required to participate in an oral presentation on a topic of current interest in Microbiology. More information will be provided on these presentations in lab.

Bio 46 Laboratory Manuals will be handed out during the first lab, but you can find a copy of the first lab on Blackboard. LAB MEETS IN 206 LSC.

We have a Canvas site that will contain lecture outlines and/or lecture notes, any PowerPoint presentations, announcements and other useful items.

Academic Honor Principle The Dartmouth College Student Handbook states "Fundamental to the principle of independent learning are the requirements of honesty and integrity in the performance of academic assignments, both in the classroom and outside. Dartmouth operates on the principle of academic honor, without proctoring of examinations. Students who submit work which is not their own or who commit other acts of academic dishonesty forfeit the opportunity to continue at Dartmouth." There are a number of situations in which a student in Biology 46 might find himor herself tempted to violate the Academic Honor Principle. These situations include (but are not limited to) the following:
a) Examinations must be completed without reference to written materials other than those provided with the exam paper and must be completed without communication with anyone else (the only permissible exception is that students may request clarification of any exam question from the course faculty and staff who are present expressly for that purpose). The answers that you provide must be entirely your own work.
b) Under certain circumstances, we may allow exams to be re-graded by the instructors. Any alteration of the answers between the time when the graded papers were returned to the student and the time when the paper was submitted for re-grading constitutes a breach of the Academic Honor Principle. To deter this practice, we photocopy exam pages.
c) Laboratory experiments are performed alone. The student misrepresenting the work of another as his or her own is in violation of the Academic Honor Principle.
Honesty is the foundation of the academic pursuit of knowledge. In recognition of this, the faculty and staff of Biology 46 will not overlook any violations of the Academic Honor Principle. Indeed, the Faculty Handbook of Dartmouth College states explicitly that College Faculty is obligated to report potential violations of the Academic Honor Principle to the Dartmouth College Committee on Standards.
NOTE: Students with disabilities who are taking this course and may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see Professor Guerinot as soon as possible. We also encourage you to stop by the Academic Skills Center in Collis Center to register for support services.
We realize that some students may wish to take part in religious observances that fall during this academic term. Should you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please come speak with Professor Guerinot before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
