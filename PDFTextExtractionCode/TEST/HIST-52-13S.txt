Course Description:
The century after Germany's first unification (1871) was an era of dramatic transformations and contradictions: while Germans enjoyed unprecedented prosperity, technological advances, and mobility, they also unleashed and experienced terror, total war, foreign occupations, and mass murder. Contrasting visions of a new society ushered in a range of different regimes--an Empire, a liberal republic, a murderous racist dictatorship, Communist rule, and a democratic welfare state--yet these visions also led to the emancipation of women, the development of a new consumer society, the transformation of everyday lives, and the creation of environmentalist movements and new counter-cultures.
Reviewing Germany's history from 1871 until today, this course will explore the drastic changes that permeated German life. Our central theme will be the forces that foster change: how did ideas, everyday experiences, and major political trends intersect to transform each other in modern Germany? What tensions did these changes bring forth; how did various groups and individuals interpret, embrace, challenge, and/or resist the social, political, and cultural changes pursued by different German leaders and regimes? Why did certain changes survive for decades, while others failed and ended abruptly? Drawing from a wide variety of primary sources, including film, literature, political tracts, letters, and historical speeches, the course will present a multidimensional picture of the social, intellectual, political, and cultural transitions that shaped German experiences in modern times.
Course Requirements:
This course aims to develop a variety of skills:
1. The mastery of facts and concepts.

2. The ability to assess and interpret various sources (both primary and secondary, visual and textual).
3. The ability to express ideas and arguments (both in writing and in class).
You will be assessed on all of these skills. For this purpose, the course includes several different requirements:
1. Participation (20%): Following the first week, Wednesdays will be devoted to discussing the readings. You will be divided into two discussion sections. Students are expected to complete the assigned readings prior to these Wednesday meetings and to attend and actively participate actively in all discussions.
In addition, you are expected to post on Blackboard two questions, thoughts, or comments that you had about the assigned readings for the week. Those postings are intended to be informal observations to help spark our discussions. They are due at 12:00 AM on the night before discussion sections. You must post these under "class discussion" on Blackboard, and they will be part of your overall participation grade.
2. Reading Essay (15%): During week 3 and 4 of the term, each student must write one essay (up to 1,200 words, about 4 pages, double-spaced) about the readings assigned for one of these weeks. (During the first week of the term, each student will be assigned to a specific week). Professor Greenberg will assign a question the week before the essay is due. This essay will be due on the day before the discussion for the corresponding readings (i.e., either Tuesday, April 9, or Tuesday, April 16) at 7:00 PM.
3. Midterm Exam (15%): There will be an in-class midterm exam on Thursday, April 25, at 12:00 PM (x-hour). The exam will consist of identifications and short questions, and will be based on lectures and reading materials.
4. Question Essay (20%): In the second part of the term, each student must write an essay, which will be based on questions listed on Blackboard. It must be submitted Thursday, May 16th, at 7:00 PM. Length limit: 2,000 words (about 6-7 pages).
5. Final exam (30%), consisting of two parts: 1. A 2 hours in-class exam on Saturday, June 1st, at 8:00 AM. This is worth 15% of your final grade. 2. A take-home essay of up to 1,500 words, due on Monday, June 3, at 5:00 PM. This is worth 15% of your final grade.

Course Policies
Attendance:
You are expected to attend all classes. If you do miss class, it is your responsibility to get the missed material from a classmate. Students who would fail to attend more than three classes (either lecture of discussion), or more than two of the discussion sections, will receive a zero grade on their participation, which will severely reduce their final grade. Moreover, since discussion section are highly important for this class, any absence from discussion will result in a reduction of the student's overall participation grade.
Writing:
All written material should be submitted in 12 point Times New Roman Font, double-spaced, with 1 inch margins. Sources must be cited in footnotes. Submissions are accepted via upload on Blackboard. You may not email me your paper. For guidelines citing sources, see the short citation guide ("how to write footnotes") provided on the course website on Blackboard.
All submitted written material must be your own work and must conform to the Dartmouth honor code (see http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/acad-honor.html). If you have questions about citing the work of others in your paper, please come see me before submitting your work.
Note on late submissions:
Any late submission will be penalized a two-third letter grade (for example, from A- to B). Additionally, late submissions will be penalized another third letter grade for every 12 hours after the initial deadline (for example, from B to B-). If you know you will need an extension, you must contact Professor Greenberg well in advance. Last minute requests will not be approved.
When submitting a paper via Blackboard, it is your responsibility to make sure that you have uploaded the right file. If you submit an incorrect file (a rough draft instead of a final draft,

notes, a different assignment etc.), your essay will be subject to late penalties (applied from the original deadline) until I receive the correct file.
Technology Policy:
Laptops are allowed during lectures, but must only be used for note taking purposes. No laptops will be allowed on discussion days.
Accommodation:
All students who may need academic adjustments or accommodations during the term are strongly encouraged to convey those needs to me as soon as possible. Early communication is especially important in cases in which students will miss class due to athletic events or religious holidays; it is also important in cases involving disabilities, which may require in-class or other accommodations. During the first week of class, students will be given an opportunity to indicate requests in these areas via an in-class survey; they are also invited to discuss these requests in person and/or via email. All communications will remain confidential, although it may be necessary to consult with the Student Disabilities Coordinator in some cases involving documented disabilities.
