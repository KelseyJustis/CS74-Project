Course description and objectives
This class introduces the history and practices of African-derived religious traditions as they have developed in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Black American communities in the United States. These religious systems will be discussed with reference to their representation in the mainstream media (in television shows and Hollywood movies, for example), and analyzed according to the more complex realities of their practitioners' everyday lives. Three themes to be explored in each tradition include 1) gender identity;2) racial identity and resistance; and 3) aesthetics. Among the questions to be posed throughout the quarter are the following:
· Do women wield religious power in this tradition, and if so, on what terms? · How do these religions effect practitioners' responses to oppressive social conditions? · How do `art' and other material objects encode moral-ethical values? · How do these religions enable practitioners to fashion a communal identity?
The success of this course will rest upon your active participation. My goals for this course are that YOU:
 Collaborate with fellow students throughout the quarter in order to create a classroom community.
 Increase the range of your theoretical facility with concepts drawn from a range of scholarly disciplines, including the history of religions and anthropology. 
 Craft assignments that combine class material with outside readings and cultivate your unique voice.  
 Learn to appreciate the range of religious formations and cultural modes to be found within the African Diaspora/Black Atlantic. 
If these objectives are met, you should be able to:
o Hold up your end of a casual conversation with a practitioner of one of these traditions, and enjoy doing so. 

2   
o Deconstruct and otherwise critically assess media reports concerning African religions of the Americas.
o Better understand the religious legacy of West and Central African peoples in the contemporary Atlantic world.
o Explain relationship of ganja to Rastafari identity, and what it means to have `mojo.' o Identify the Black religious history of some quintessentially American cultural forms.
Requirements
1.You are expected to attend class regularly and finish assigned readings before class. 2. You are required to contribute to class discussions, and inform me beforehand of any absences.Come prepared to be called on at random and to share your impressions of the material. The quality of your contribution overall will be determined by:
a) Frequency and relevance of your verbal comments. b) Preparation for class, as expressed in knowledgeable references made to the contents
of assigned readings. c) Ability to comprehend, communicate, and critically reflect on the themes and theses
of the assigned readings. d) Punctuality. (Snooze=lose.)
3. You need to meet with me once before the midterm, either during my office hours or at a time of your choice. 4.You must agree to complete a midterm examand afinal exam, due at the end of the quarter. 5. You must obtain the readings assignments via the Blackboard Menu in Syllabus, "Syllabus with Links to Readings," or Course Materials,"Readings Hyperlinked." 6. You are responsible for presenting during one of the class sessions on one article/book chapter paired with the day's reading assignment. This is either a reading listed on the syllabus as "{for presenter}" or one to be assigned via email/office hours. Presenting entails does not entail summarizing its contents for the class, but instead drawing out its main points, and offering suggestions for analysis, preferably with a printed hand-out or Powerpoint presentation the class can follow. I will grade you on the content of your reports, as well as the following:
1. Organization--was your presentation organized logically? 2. Clarity--could we hear you and understand what you were trying to say? 3. Eye Contact--did you make eye contact with everyone (not just with the professor?) 4. Enthusiasm--did you convey your interest in the topic under discussion?
7.In addition, you must observe the following standards forcourtesy:
*No audible yawning, flamboyant stretching, or obvious eating

3   
*No whispering or passing notes
Please note: The professor reserves the right to fail/withhold credit for the course unless all of the assignments have been turned in on time. Grading
Your final grade will be decided according to the following components:
Midterm exam/Final exam: 60% Classroom participation: 30%
Presentation and short assignments (graded on a ,+, or - basis):10%
EXAMPLE: STUDENT X ATTENDS ALL CLASS MEETINGS BUT ONE, RECEIVES A 90% ON ALL OF HER EXAMS, ATTENDS ALL OF THE EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES, AND FINISHES ALL OF HER ASSIGNMENTS ON TIME. HOWEVER, SHE ONLY ASKS A QUESTION OR MAKES A COMMENT FOUR TIMES IN CLASS OVER THE COURSE OF THE QUARTER (APPROXIMATELY 28 CLASS SESSIONS). What is Student X's final grade?B-.
Please read the components to the grade once again! 100%-30% classroom participation=70%. With the extra credit factored in, Student X will receive--at most--a B-.
Note the grade descriptions listed by the Dartmouth College Office of the Registrar: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/transcript/grade_descriptions.html

4   
If you have any issues--ranging from shyness/introversion, special difficulty in raising your hand and speaking in front of a group to a disability (please see more below)--that could prevent you from achieving your desired grade in the course based on the grading components and percentages above, please make an appointment see me at the start of the quarter. We can create a plan then to ensure your success. Do not be "Student X"! ADDITIONAL CONCERNS 1. Religious Observances:Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that fall during the term. Should you have a religious observance that conflicts with participation in the course, please come speak with the instructor as soon as possible to discuss appropriate accommodations.

5    2. Illness: Based on our experience over the years, we can report that the #1 predictor of success in REL 17 is to come to class. We urge you, therefore, to attend class on a regular basis.
3. Disabilities: Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities who may require disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to see me as soon as possible to discuss your particular needs. All discussions will remain confidential, although we may consult the Student Accessibility Services office to discuss appropriate implementation of any accommodation requested.
Academic Integrity
Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Use your own words, and credit the origins of the facts and ideas used in your writing. This applies to any text found on the internet. Do not cut and paste sentences from elsewhere and insert them into your own papers. You must acknowledge all borrowings using a standard citation format, properly followed. I reserve the right to use the anti-plagiarism software www.turnitin.com to ensure that the writings you submit are yours alone, but passages from your work can also be easily "Googled" to confirm the same.
WARNING: Websites are notoriously poor sources of information about African religions of the Americas. They tend to be outdated, stereotyped, or simply incorrect;therefore, plagiarizing--that is, stealing--from the web exposes you not only to failure of the class but also innumerable and profound factual errors!
