Dartmouth  College   Religion  61  (Identical  to  AAAS  82)   DIST:  SOC;  WCult:  CI   Spring  2013   Tuesday  &  Thursday  10A         Religion  and  the  Civil  Rights  Movement   Randall  Balmer   E-mail:  randall.balmer@dartmouth.edu      Course  Description   An  examination  of  the  importance  of  religion  in  the  drive  for  civil  rights  during  the  1950s  and  1960s.  The   course  will  look  at  the  role  of  activists,  clergy,  sermons,  and  music  in  forging  the  consensus  in  favor  of   civil  rights.      Open  to  all.         This  course  will  open  with  the  historical  context  for  understanding  the  civil  rights  movement:  the   crucible  of  slavery,  the  imposition  of  Jim  Crow  laws  after  Reconstruction,  the  persistent  denial  of  rights   and  opportunities  to  African  Americans.  We'll  examine  the  rise  and  the  influence  of  such  organizations   as  the  Ku  Klux  Klan  and  the  failure  of  blacks  to  receive  justice  in  white  courtrooms,  as  illustrated  in  the   Scottsboro  case.  We'll  then  explore  the  theology  that  lay  behind  the  civil-rights  struggle,  particularly   that  of  Howard  Thurman  as  well  as  the  Social  Gospel  ideas  of  Walter  Rauschenbusch.               For  the  civil  rights  struggle  itself  --  which  is  generally  traced  to  Rosa  Parks's  refusal  to  surrender  her   seat  on  a  Montgomery,  Alabama,  bus  on  December  1,  1955  --  we'll  rely  both  on  textual  materials  as   well  as  on  excerpts  from  the  award-winning  PBS  series,  Eyes  on  the  Prize:  America's  Civil  Rights  Years,   1954-1965,  treating  the  documentary  itself  as  a  text.  The  life  and  theology  of  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.  and   the  Southern  Christian  Leadership  Conference  play  a  prominent  role  in  this  segment.            The  penultimate  section  looks  at  the  Freedom  Summer  of  1964  and  its  effects  on  the  state  of   Mississippi.  The  final  segment  examines  the  relation  of  civil-rights  leaders  with  other  African  American   movements,  such  as  the  Student  Non-Violent  Coordinating  Committee  and  the  Nation  of  Islam.  We'll   conclude  with  an  assessment  of  the  long-term  effects  of  the  civil-rights  struggle.
