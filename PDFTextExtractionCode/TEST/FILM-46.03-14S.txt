Course Description
The public life of religion and science seems to be characterized by escalating conflict and intractable polarization. In this course we draw on several different scholarly disciplines to consider the public intersection of science and religion with our responsibilities and obligations as citizens in a democratic polity, paying particular attention to problems of participation, representation, and deliberation as they are mediated through the press, new media, film, television, and public spaces. We will examine case studies from current controversies over stem cell research, cloning, reproductive genetics, environmental policy, human origins, and sexuality to explore who is creating and maintaining these public controversies, and for what purposes. Most importantly, we will unpack the various ways that "science and religion" is a defining confrontation in the development of American democracy, whether in the contested separation of church and state, the rise of conservative religious movements in electoral politics, or the supposed decline of American scientific and technological dominance in the world.
Distributive: Social Analysis (SOC). World Culture: Western Cultures (W).

Course Goals
The overall course goal is to acquire basic competence in evaluating contentious public debates as institutional contests of credibility that shape what we can talk about, what we know about it, how we talk about it, and what we can do about it. This competence is important for any future endeavor involving participation in public life, such as advertising, social activism, public relations, religious leadership, filmmaking, marketing, public policy, electoral politics, journalism, or global rock superstardom.
An additional course goal is to develop digital scholarship skills such as media archive search, digital media analysis, metadata production, infrastructure design, digital curation, online collaboration, and digital publishing. Such skills are personally valuable and professionally desirable. To provide evidence of your abilities to others, the course implements a digital badging system where badges are earned as skills are acquired and demonstrated. Once earned, badges can be displayed (or not, your call) in social media, web pages, or email to communicate your abilities and achievements.
Course Meetings
Regular class meets MWF. Usually Monday and Wednesday will be a combination of me lecturing and us discussing interesting things in class. Technically this course is a Topics in Television course, so you can expect "lecturing" to include screening of short video excerpts. Usually Friday will be reserved for student-led presentation and discussion of course readings, which we may enliven further with the help of guest lecturers and/or discussants. We will sort out assignments for these presentations in the first week or so.
X-hours will be used occasionally for digital scholarship sessions. We will meet in the regular classroom or Jones Media Center to spend time developing digital scholarship skills through a variety of workshops and exercises in content creation, commentary, and publishing. These sessions will be linked to course themes and material, so we will develop our digital scholarship skills as part of learning about science and religion. Details of required meetings and locations can be found in the Course Schedule.
Note that the course also makes extensive use of Canvas (e.g. weekly quizzes, assigned readings, etc.). Students are responsible for gaining access to Canvas and staying current with material on the course Canvas site outside of class meetings.

Learning Objectives
The course is divided into three modules, each with its own learning objectives. In parallel with these modules, the digital scholarship lab sessions will pursue an additional learning objective.
In Module One, we discuss theories of the public sphere and credibility. The basic objective is to understand how and why science and religion bother to participate in American public life in the first place. Upon completion of this module, students will be able to describe theories of the public sphere, compare and contrast the concepts of truth and credibility, identify multiple ways that public sphere activity shapes everyday social life, critically evaluate the role of "the public" in public debate, identify patterns of consumption and production in American media, describe the consequences of these patterns for the public sphere, and relate the participation of science and religion in American media to the pursuit of credibility.
In Module Two, we consider apparent public conflicts between science and religion as episodes in the development of American democracy. The basic objective is to understand how and why arguments about science and religion in the public sphere are also efforts to work out how we are going to resolve conflicts in a pluralistic democracy. Upon completion of this module, students will be able to analyze participation in public life in terms of moral projects, compare and contrast the "knowledge deficit" model and its alternatives, distinguish between moral and epistemological arguments in the public sphere, relate the historical trajectory of religion and science in American electoral politics to concepts of credibility (from Module One), and evaluate the role of legal institutions in settling public arguments about science and religion.
In Module Three, we discuss how public debate reflects and creates divisions and contention within American institutions, even while revealing similarities between apparently opposed institutions. The basic objective is to understand how and why public arguments involving science and religion are also contests between diverse possibilities within science and within religion. Upon completion of this module, students will be able to evaluate the effects of uncertainty and doubt on credibility (from Module One), use examples from science and religion to show how internal institutional conflicts are escalated by American media, identify sources of commonality in public discourse, and evaluate the probable success of efforts to use media to achieve social change.

In the Digital Scholarship sessions and exercises, we will develop our digital scholarship skills as part of learning about science and religion in American media. The basic objective is to gain competence in digital scholarship. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to search and retrieve archival content from a variety of digital archives, apply critical knowledge and communication skills, and use the Mediathread publishing platform to generate digital publications that integrate original analysis and commentary with archival textual, video, and interactive content. Students will demonstrate this competence by producing a digital scholarship project using Mediathread.
Texts and Resources
There are two required books, available at Wheelock Books (and elsewhere):
Science in Public: Communication, Culture, And Credibility, by Jane Gregory and Steve Miller (Basic Books).
The God Strategy: How Religion Became a Political Weapon in America, by David Domke and Kevin Coe (Oxford University Press). Be sure to get the updated 2010 edition.
All other required course readings are available electronically through the course Canvas page. In the printed course schedule these readings are marked with <C>.
We will also make use of Mediathread, which is a web-based application that will have course-specific access available to enrolled students.
Badges
In addition to the usual grades, you will have the opportunity to earn digital badges that provide an online visual record of course achievements. Early in the quarter you can earn badges by attending Mediathread training workshops, completing Mediathread exercises, and providing feedback on the Mediathread platform. This track culminates in a Digital Media Analysis badge. Later in the quarter you can earn badges by completing a series of response memos, and by designing and executing a digital scholarship project. This track culminates in a Digital Scholarship badge.

Grading
Your final course grade will be calculated in Canvas's Grade Center on the basis of the following five course requirements:
1. Class participation (20%). Participation includes attendance at class periods and specified X-hours, active class discussions, and delivering a presentation on an assigned course reading to the class. If you miss four or more class periods (including X-hours), you will automatically receive zero points for this component of your grade. I will record a letter grade (+/-) for participation in Canvas.
2. Weekly on-line quizzes (10% combined). A new quiz will be available each Monday after class through the course Canvas page. Each quiz will be due before class on the following Monday. You must take all of the quizzes. Every quiz will be automatically graded and assigned a score (out of 10 points) by Canvas. Numeric quiz scores will be added together and converted into a percentage to generate the combined quiz grade for the course.
3. Take-home midterm examination (20%). The written midterm examination will cover material from Module One. It will be distributed on April 7 and due back April 14. I will inform you of the composition and the grading procedure for the midterm before distributing the midterm. I will record a letter grade (+/-) for the midterm in Canvas.
4. Take-home final examination (20%). The written final examination will cover material from the entire course. I will inform you of the composition and the grading procedure for the final examination well in advance of the final examination date. I will record a letter grade (+/-) for the final examination in Canvas.
5. Digital scholarship (30%). You will be required to attend digital scholarship training sessions, complete assigned exercises using the Mediathread platform, and create a project that develops and showcases your skills. The exact contours of each project will vary and will be developed in consultation with the course instructor. All projects will include a diary of your thoughts, collaborations, and decisions. I will record a letter grade (+/-) for digital scholarship in Canvas.
All conversion between letter grades and points will follow Canvas defaults.

Academic Honor
Students are responsible for compliance with the Academic Honor Principle: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~uja/honor/. We will follow Dartmouth College guidelines for responding to suspected violations. Consequences of such violation may include a failing grade in the course.
This course contains both individual and collaborative requirements. I expect that responses to quizzes and take-home examinations will be your own individual work. I expect that digital scholarship will be collaborative, with the requirement that you explicitly credit all sources from which you draw as you develop your project, including people with whom you have collaborated or who have otherwise provided assistance to you. Whatever the assignment, submitting a copy of another person's work (even in part) as your own work violates the Academic Honor Principle.
If you have any questions about whether or not something is a violation of the Academic Honor Principle, ask me first!
Student Needs
Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services are encouraged to see me privately as early as possible in the term. Students requiring disability-related academic adjustments and services must consult the Student Accessibility Services office (301 Collis Student Center, 646-9900, Student.Accessibility.Services@Dartmouth.edu). Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to their professor. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.
Students who have a religious observance that conflicts with participation in the course should come speak with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
