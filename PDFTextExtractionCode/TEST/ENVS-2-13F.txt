Description of Course The main objective of this course is to provide an introduction to environmental science,
which is a study of the natural world and how it is influenced by, and influences, people. We will examine the physical, biological, chemical and other natural sciences at a moderate level of intensity. This is an introduction to a wide variety of environmental topics, many of which you can explore in greater depth in other courses. There will be two 65-minute exams during class time and a final exam. Two environmental problem sets will be assigned to give hands-on experience in examining environmental issues, making calculations, and reaching conclusions. The completion of an audit of your residential and transportation energy use will help you gain a greater understanding of energy dynamics in human systems.

Due dates for problem sets and the energy audit are on the following page. Problem Sets and the

Energy Audit are due at 3 PM in 113 Steele Hall on their respective due dates. One point will be

subtracted for every hour that an assignment is late. Problem Set help sessions will be held on the

night before each due date from 5-6 PM in 101 Fairchild. The Energy Audit will require personal

energy-use data (home+ food + transportation) for a recent one-year period in your life.
